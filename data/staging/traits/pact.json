When you defy the wishes of your Patron, you lose an alignment, up to a maximum of 3. For each alignment you lose, your Spell Attacks from your Patron's School of Magic suffer a -1 Attack Penalty. At -3 alignment, you can no longer Channel Spells from your Patron's School. Alignment can be restored by fulfilling tasks for your Patron or taking significant actions that please them.",
