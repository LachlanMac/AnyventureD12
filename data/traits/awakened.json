Heavier objects require a concentration check exceeding their bulk; failure deals 1 psychic damage per bulk as feedback. If used as a projectile to attack a creature, the target must make a defense check greater than the object's bulk or take physical damage equal to its bulk. You can also telekinetically use throwing weapons with this action, but replace the throwing attack roll with a concentration roll.",
