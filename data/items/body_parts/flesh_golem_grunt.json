  "name": "Flesh Golem (Grunt)",
  "description": "A more robust construct stitched together from disparate body parts and animated through biosculpting. The parts can be harvested from humanoid, beast, or monster creatures, but each part must come from a separate creature to ensure the golem's stability. Golems can be activated or deactivated, counting against the owner's pet limit and taking the form of their equivalent statblock.",
