  "name": "Glyph of Portal",
  "description": "A magical inscription carved into a threshold such as a doorway, window, or piece of material that forms an unbroken shape. This creates a permanent portal marker at that location with a unique command word. A temporary version of this glyph can be carved with the same command word, which when activated opens a portal for 1 minute. Any creature that passes through the temporary threshold is teleported to the location of the permanent glyph. After 1 minute, the temporary glyph is destroyed. The permanent glyph remains and can be used repeatedly. Both glyphs must be on the same plane of existence.",
