  "name": "Glyph of Pocket",
  "description": "A magical inscription carved into an enclosed container such as a bag, chest, or box. The same glyph can then be carved again on a larger container or enclosed space such as a small room or vault. While both glyphs are on the same plane, the opening of the smaller container serves as a portal to the larger container where only objects can be passed. The maximum space for the larger pocket container is 3 cubic units.",
