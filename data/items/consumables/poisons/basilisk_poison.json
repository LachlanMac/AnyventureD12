  "description": "A poison that when ingested or applied through a coated weapon causes 5 toxic damage each round, requiring an initial endurance check of 9 to avoid. As with all poisons, this check is reduced by 1 each time it is made, with the effects of the poison being cleared upon a success. If a creature takes damage from this poison 5 times, they turn into stone and enter a stasis.",
