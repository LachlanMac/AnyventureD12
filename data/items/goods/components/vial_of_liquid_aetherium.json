  "name": "Vial of Liquid Aetherium",
  "description": "A vial of shimmering, silvery liquid that glows with an otherworldly iridescence. Created by combining an aetherium nugget with quicksilver and allowing the two metals to amalgamate over the course of a day. The resulting liquid metal is highly unstable and radiates magical energy, making it invaluable for channeling reality-warping chaos magic. The amalgamation process requires careful temperature control and constant stirring to prevent the mixture from solidifying prematurely.",
