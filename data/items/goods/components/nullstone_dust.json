  "name": "Nullstone Dust",
  "description": "A fine, dark gray powder that seems to absorb light around it, creating subtle distortions in the air. The dust feels unnaturally cold to the touch and leaves a faint residue of entropy on surfaces. Created by grinding electrum shavings with pulverized obsidian through a careful alchemical process, this powder disrupts magical energies and destabilizes reality. Often used by chaos mages to channel spells that erode defenses or warp space. This recipe yields 3 doses.",
