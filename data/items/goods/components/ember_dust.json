  "name": "Ember Dust",
  "description": "A fine, glowing orange-red powder that radiates gentle warmth and occasionally releases tiny sparks. Created through careful alchemical mixing of combustible elements, this dust maintains a constant internal heat that makes it useful for both magical and practical applications. When sprinkled, it leaves behind faint scorch marks and the acrid scent of sulfur. This recipe yields 5 doses.",
