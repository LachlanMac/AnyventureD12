  "description": "Through Pain, We Are Cleansed\nPurifier cultures believe that suffering and hardship burn away weakness, leaving only strength and truth. They practice ritual self-mortification, embrace painful ordeals, and see comfort as corruption of the spirit. To them, easy paths breed weakness, while agony forges unbreakable will. Pain is not avoidedâ€”it is welcomed as the ultimate teacher and purifier of body and soul.",
