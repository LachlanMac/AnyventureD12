You regain 1 Resolve whenever you face a worthy opponent in single combat, overcome a significant physical challenge, or defend others from danger. However, backing down from a fight, fleeing from battle, or showing cowardice causes you to lose 2 Resolve and gain a Stress from shame. If you go more than a week without facing some form of meaningful conflict or challenge, you become restless and gain 1 Stress. You can spend 1 Resolve to ignore pain and continue fighting for one round, even when critically wounded.",
