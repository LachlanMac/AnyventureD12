You regain 1 Resolve whenever you complete a profitable trade, negotiate a favorable deal, or identify a valuable opportunity others missed. However, losing money on a deal or being cheated causes you to lose 1 Resolve and gain anxiety about future transactions. If your total wealth drops below what you consider 'acceptable' (GM discretion based on your background), you gain 1 Stress per day until you restore your fortunes.
