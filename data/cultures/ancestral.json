      "description": "The spirits of your forebears provide stability and wisdom. You regain 1 Resolve whenever you honor your ancestors through ritual, uphold ancient traditions, or act according to ancestral wisdom. However, violating sacred customs or disrespecting the old ways causes you to lose 2 Resolve and feel the ancestors' disappointment (1 Stress). During times of great uncertainty, you can commune with ancestral spirits through meditation (10 minutes) to convert 1 Stress into guidance - this grants you +2 bonus dice on your next skill check that involves wisdom or tradition. The dead remember all debts, and their judgment weighs heavily on your soul.",
