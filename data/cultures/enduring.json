You regain 1 Resolve whenever you endure significant hardship without breaking, help others survive difficult circumstances, or make something useful from nothing. However, when faced with waste, luxury, or people who've never struggled, you feel disconnected and lose 1 Resolve while gaining resentment (1 Stress). If you live comfortably for more than a month without any real challenges, you become restless and gain 1 Stress weekly until you find meaningful hardship again. You can spend 1 Resolve to push through any physical pain or exhaustion for one scene, drawing on memories of worse times you've survived.",
