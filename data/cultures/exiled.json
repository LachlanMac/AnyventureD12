You regain 1 Resolve whenever you help another outcast or marginalized person, or when you prove wrong those who rejected you. However, being reminded of your exile or facing rejection from a group you hoped to join causes you to lose 1 Resolve and feel the old wounds reopen (1 Stress). When you reach your breaking point (0 Resolve), instead of becoming Broken, you can enter a desperate fury - gain +2 dice to all actions for one scene, but gain 2 Stress afterward. You understand that sometimes you only have yourself to rely on.",
