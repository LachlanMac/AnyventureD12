  "description": "Goblins are small, quick-witted humanoids that have built one of the most spectaculur and advanced societies on Atlah. Goblins are typically born with a more purple hue, but turn green in their later years due to their civilization being built on the dark side of the moon where the green glow of Viridus is always directly overhead. The goblin love of creating has created a culture of meritocracy where those in power are the best crafters.",
