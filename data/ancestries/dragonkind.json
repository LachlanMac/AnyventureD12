  "description": "Dragonkind are humanoids with draconic features, sharing a mix of physical traits from their draconic ancestors. These individuals are often imposing, with scaled skin, claws, and sometimes tails or horns. Dragonkind are the only humanoids to live on the surface of Kragfel - their ancestral blood seemingly keeping them safe from the mindless dragons that patrol the barren moon. Dragonkind live extremely long lives, with their youth spent in small tribes before they are encouraged to travel the other worlds when they reach adulthood.",
