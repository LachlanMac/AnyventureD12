  "description": "Kobolds are small, reptilian humanoids with features that blend lizard-like and canine traits. Once blessed with the monumental task of rearing drakes in the Age of Dragons, kobolds have since abandoned that lineage, instead building sprawling cities throughout the tunnels of Kragfel that have yet to be mapped. Kobolds are known for their exceptionally short lives and large families, resulting in a culture that values initiative over playing it safe.",
