AnyventureD12 UA Secondary Module Concepts
==========================================

Purpose
-------
Working scratchpad for themes, mechanical hooks, and must-hit ideas while iterating on UA secondary modules. Keep this focused on direction-setting notes (not full option writeups) so we can track intent before locking designs.

Modules
-------
Acolyte (Acolyte + Cultist + Zealot blend)
- Sworn brotherhood/sisterhood flavor.
- Dark vs light branching, culminating in a tier 7 choice.
- Ancient rituals: scribing or awakening forgotten spells.
- Ritualist vibe; consider Armor of Faith, Enduring Faith/Reward the Faithful, Unwavering traits.
- Zealot edge: brief immunity to mental conditions, high devotion payoffs.

Arcane Artisan
- Magical crafting specialist focused on weapon infusions and arcane trinkets.
- Channel spells through embedded cores; hybrid between crafter and battlemage support.
- Explore limited-use augment slots and unique focus creation.

Biomancer
- Hold for later pass. Potential bio-modification theme when ready.

Counselor
- Social/resolve healer: mental wellness, morale boosts, condition relief.
- Non-combat support actions that stabilize resolve and inspire allies.

Juggernaut
- Heavy armor/deflection powerhouse.
- Objectives: anchor positioning, absorb punishment, retaliate after blocks.

Local Legend
- Folk-hero tongue-in-cheek module.
- Community renown perks, tall-tale maneuvers, morale sharing.

Monster Slayer
- Anti-monster toolkit scaling by creature size.
- Track size-specific bonuses, lock in exploitation actions, possibly mark targets.

Monster Taming (new concept slot)
- Capture/tame creatures; leverage loyalty actions.
- Blend with outdoors or mystical control without stepping on Hunter.

Mounted Combatant (rename from mountee)
- Rebrand module name; combine mounted prowess with either lancer or cavalry support.
- Needs unique mounted action economy so it justifies a full module.

Naturalist
- Nature affinity and gentle taming path via Persuasion instead of Wildcraft.
- Survival utility: tracking, shelter, terrain manipulation without duplicating Hunter/Druid.

Quickshot
- Dual sidearm specialist (pistols/hand crossbows/off-hand guns).
- Close-quarters ranged combat, rapid reactions, possible draw-and-fire sequences.

Tempest
- On hold for now.

Trance Master
- Self-induced trance states for empowered casting and combat.
- Track drugging mechanics: boosted channels, altered defenses, risk tradeoffs.

Evasive Defense Specialist (new UA slot)
- Goal: alternative defensive path emphasizing nimble avoidance over armor.
- Concepts: adaptive footwork, redirecting momentum, short burst phasing, energy-efficient dodges.
