  "description": "Elves are wild humanoids, distinguisable by their long, pointed ears and skin tones which range from light blue to dark green. They typically live hard, long lives in small settlements in the most dangerous of the Fonteran jungles as a result of their displacement from their wars with the Orcs. Elven blood is infused with the cosmos, creating a culture that has learned to worship the stars and their meaning.",
