  "name": "Erode",
  "description": "You use strands of arcane energy to erode the defense of a creature within a moderate (20 unit) distance, decreasing their mitigation to all sources by 1 if they fail a resilience check of 7. While you concentrate on this spell, the penalty increases by 1 at the end of your target's turn up to a maximum of 5. If you do not roll at least 2 successes, instead of concentration, the spell lasts a minute but also targets you.",
