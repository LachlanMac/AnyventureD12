  "description": "You distort yourself for 1 minute. Any time you are attacked, roll a d10. On a 9 or higher, you blink out of existence and back in, taking no damage. Otherwise, you make a defense check as normal. If you do not roll at least 2 successes on your spell check, when you blink out on a 9 or higher, you disappear until the start of your next turn. At the start of your turn, roll again - on a 9 or higher, you remain vanished for another round.",
