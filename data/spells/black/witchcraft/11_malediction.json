At the end of each of their next 3 full rests, they must make a resilience check of 10 or higher or take 4 dark damage. If you have any of their hair or blood, the damage is increased to 9. Any success ends this spell prematurely.",
    "charge":"Rather than needing to encounter the target, you need only know of their existence. Additionally, the requirement for needing blood or hair is removed to benefit from the extra damage.",
