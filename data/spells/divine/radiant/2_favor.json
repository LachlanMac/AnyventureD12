    "description": "You touch an adjacent creature and ask the heavens to grant them a blessing. At any point until your target's next full rest, they can attempt to benefit from this blessing after making a skill check by rolling a 1d12. On a result of 12, the skill check can be completely rerolled. On a 5 or higher, a single dice can be rerolled from the skill check. The favor is only consumed on a success, but can only be attempted once per skill check. You cannot target yourself for this spell.",
