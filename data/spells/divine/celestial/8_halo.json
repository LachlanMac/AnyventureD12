Any creature affected by this halo gains 5 mitigation to dark damage but suffers a -5 penalty to divine mitigation. The halo also emits a magical light within a very short (5 unit) radius that forces undead or dark creatures who start their turn within the light to make an endurance check of 7 or become blinded until the end of their turn.",
