    "description": "You surround yourself with a cold mist, allowing you to shape icicles at will for the next minute. You can use a subsequent action to fire an icicle at a creature within a very short (5 unit) distance, forcing them to make a defense check of 5 or take 4 points of cold damage. The mist has enough vapor to summon 3 icicles before fading.",
    "charge":"The spell no longer has a duration, and instead lasts as long as you maintain concentration. There is no limit to the amount of icicles that can be summoned from the mist.",
