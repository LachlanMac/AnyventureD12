  "description": "You attempt to rekindle a humanoid or beast's spirit that has recently departed it's body within the last minute. To be a valid target of this spell, the body first must be restored to full health by magic. You roll a d12; on a 5 or higher, the spirit is restored back to the body, and instead of dead, it becomes unconscious. On a failure, the spell fails and cannot be used to target the same body.",
  "charge": "Instead of rolling a d12, the spell automatically succeeds, but the creature can never be the target of this spell again.",
