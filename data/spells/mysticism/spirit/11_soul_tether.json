    "description": "You target a creature within a very short (5 unit) distance and tether your soul to theirs. While you concentrate on this spell, you can use a subsequent action to attempt to drain or give health to the creature you are tethered to. If attempting to drain, the creature must make a resilience check of 10, or they take 4 true damage and you gain 2 health. If attempting to give health, you can choose an amount up to 10 health to donate. If the creature moves outside of a short (10 unit) distance, the spell ends.",
