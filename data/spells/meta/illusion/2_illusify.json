   "description": "You create minor sensory illusions within range that can affect sight, sound, or smell. You can produce one of the following effects: Create a small visual effect no larger than your hand (colored lights, sparks, moving images); Generate a quiet sound that lasts for the duration (whispers, music, animal noises); Create or alter a scent in a small area; Clean or soil a small object or area; Chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 pound of nonliving material for 1 hour; Make a small mark, symbol, or word appear on a surface. The effects are purely sensory and cannot cause damage, provide light bright enough to illuminate beyond a few feet, or create sounds loud enough to be heard beyond a moderate distance. Multiple effects can be maintained simultaneously, but each requires a separate casting.",
