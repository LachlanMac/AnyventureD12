# Environmental Hazards

Environmental hazards represent natural and supernatural dangers that characters may encounter during their adventures. These threats require careful navigation, proper preparation, and sometimes creative problem-solving to overcome safely.

## Natural Environmental Hazards

### Extreme Weather

#### Blizzards
**Damage Type**: Cold  
**Severity**: Moderate to Severe

Intense snowstorms with howling winds that create dangerous visibility and temperature conditions.

**Effects**:
- **Visibility**: Reduced to 2-5 units depending on intensity
- **Movement**: Speed reduced by half due to deep snow and wind resistance
- **Temperature**: Characters without proper protection take 1-3 Cold damage per hour
- **Exposure**: Extended exposure may cause Exhaustion or hypothermia conditions
- **Navigation**: Logic checks at +2 difficulty to maintain direction

**Survival Strategies**:
- Seek or construct windbreaks and shelters
- Bundle clothing and share body heat
- Use fire magic or heated objects for warmth
- Follow landmarks or use magical navigation
- Ration energy for essential movement only

#### Sandstorms
**Damage Type**: Physical  
**Severity**: Moderate

Powerful desert windstorms that fill the air with stinging sand and dust particles.

**Effects**:
- **Visibility**: Reduced to 1-3 units, making navigation nearly impossible
- **Breathing**: Senses checks required each hour or gain Winded condition
- **Equipment**: Sand infiltrates gear, potentially damaging delicate items
- **Abrasion**: Exposed skin takes 1 Physical damage per hour
- **Disorientation**: Easy to become lost without proper landmarks

**Survival Strategies**:
- Cover all exposed skin and breathing passages
- Seek shelter in caves, buildings, or behind large objects
- Use magical barriers or shields against wind
- Wait out the storm rather than traveling blind
- Protect sensitive equipment with waterproof coverings

#### Extreme Heat
**Damage Type**: Heat  
**Severity**: Moderate to Severe

Dangerous high temperatures that can cause dehydration, heat stroke, and exhaustion.

**Effects**:
- **Dehydration**: Requires double normal water consumption
- **Exhaustion**: Endurance checks every 2 hours or gain Winded condition
- **Heat Damage**: 1-2 Heat damage per hour without shade and water
- **Equipment Failure**: Metal items become burning hot, leather goods crack
- **Mental Effects**: Concentration checks at +1 difficulty due to heat stress

**Survival Strategies**:
- Travel during cooler dawn and dusk hours
- Seek shade during peak heat periods
- Increase water intake significantly
- Use light-colored, loose clothing for protection
- Apply cooling magic or find natural cooling sources

### Geological Hazards

#### Unstable Ground
**Damage Type**: Physical  
**Severity**: Variable

Terrain that may collapse, shift, or give way under weight, including sinkholes, rotted floors, and thin ice.

**Effects**:
- **Collapse Risk**: Coordination checks required to avoid falls
- **Fall Damage**: 2-10 Physical damage depending on depth and surface
- **Trapped**: May become pinned under debris or stuck in holes
- **Progressive Failure**: Initial collapse may trigger larger cave-ins
- **Equipment Loss**: Gear may fall into inaccessible areas

**Detection and Avoidance**:
- Senses checks to notice warning signs (creaking, sagging, cracks)
- Test suspicious areas with poles or thrown objects
- Distribute weight by crawling or using planks
- Use rope systems for safe crossing
- Mark dangerous areas for other party members

#### Rockslides
**Damage Type**: Physical  
**Severity**: High

Sudden cascades of rocks and debris down slopes, often triggered by weather, earthquakes, or movement.

**Effects**:
- **Crushing Damage**: 5-15 Physical damage from direct hits
- **Burial Risk**: May become trapped under heavy debris
- **Area Effect**: Affects large zones, difficult to avoid completely
- **Path Blocking**: May seal off routes permanently
- **Triggering**: Can be caused by loud noises or vibrations

**Survival Strategies**:
- Recognize signs of unstable slopes (loose rocks, recent slides)
- Move quickly and quietly through avalanche-prone areas
- Seek shelter behind large, stable objects during slides
- Use magic to deflect or redirect falling debris
- Establish escape routes before entering dangerous terrain

### Water Hazards

#### Rapids and Waterfalls
**Damage Type**: Physical  
**Severity**: High

Fast-moving water that can sweep characters away, causing drowning and impact injuries.

**Effects**:
- **Sweep Away**: Fitness checks required to avoid being carried downstream
- **Impact Damage**: 3-8 Physical damage from hitting rocks and obstacles
- **Drowning Risk**: Endurance checks required to hold breath underwater
- **Equipment Loss**: Unsecured gear may be washed away
- **Hypothermia**: Cold water increases risk of temperature-related damage

**Navigation Strategies**:
- Scout water conditions before attempting crossings
- Use ropes and anchors for safety lines
- Cross at narrower, calmer sections when possible
- Empty containers for emergency flotation
- Plan rescue procedures for party members in trouble

#### Quicksand and Bog
**Damage Type**: None (restraint)  
**Severity**: Moderate

Saturated ground that cannot support weight, causing characters to sink progressively deeper.

**Effects**:
- **Progressive Sinking**: Sink deeper each round without proper action
- **Movement Restriction**: Cannot move normally while stuck
- **Panic Risk**: Struggling makes sinking worse
- **Suffocation**: Eventually may cover head if fully submerged
- **Equipment Hindrance**: Heavy gear accelerates sinking

**Escape Techniques**:
- Stop struggling and spread weight horizontally
- Use floating objects or long tools for leverage
- Remove heavy equipment to reduce sinking rate
- Have allies pull with ropes from solid ground
- Use magic to solidify ground or provide lift

## Supernatural Hazards

### Magical Anomalies

#### Wild Magic Zones
**Damage Type**: Variable  
**Severity**: Unpredictable

Areas where magical energy is unstable, causing spells to behave erratically or produce unintended effects.

**Effects**:
- **Spell Distortion**: Magic produces random effects instead of intended results
- **Magical Surge**: Spontaneous magical phenomena occur regularly
- **Energy Drain**: Spellcasters may lose energy or spell slots unexpectedly
- **Reality Fluctuation**: Physical laws may temporarily change
- **Magical Items**: Enchanted equipment may malfunction or overcharge

**Navigation Strategies**:
- Minimize magical use within the zone
- Test magic effects carefully before full casting
- Use mundane solutions for problems when possible
- Mark safe paths through the anomaly
- Exit the area quickly if effects become dangerous

#### Dimensional Rifts
**Damage Type**: True  
**Severity**: Extreme

Tears in reality that connect to other planes or dimensions, creating unpredictable and dangerous effects.

**Effects**:
- **Planar Bleeding**: Effects from other dimensions leak through
- **Creature Incursions**: Beings from other planes may emerge
- **Reality Distortion**: Physical laws from other dimensions may apply
- **Energy Drain**: Life force may be pulled toward the rift
- **Temporal Effects**: Time may flow differently near rifts

**Approach Strategies**:
- Maintain maximum distance from active rifts
- Use protective magic before approaching
- Prepare for encounters with extraplanar creatures
- Document rift behavior for future reference
- Seek expert help for permanent closure

### Cursed Locations

#### Desecrated Ground
**Damage Type**: Dark  
**Severity**: Moderate

Areas tainted by evil acts or dark magic, creating zones hostile to living creatures.

**Effects**:
- **Healing Resistance**: Natural and magical healing reduced by half
- **Undead Attraction**: Greater chance of undead encounters
- **Mental Pressure**: Resilience checks required to avoid fear or despair

- Remove sources of corruption (cursed objects, remains)
- Consecrate the area with holy symbols and prayers
- Plant blessed seeds or pour holy water on the ground
- Seek assistance from divine spellcasters

#### Temporal Anomalies
**Damage Type**: None (displacement)  
**Severity**: High

Locations where time flows differently, potentially trapping characters or aging them rapidly.

**Effects**:
- **Time Dilation**: Actions may take longer or shorter than expected
- **Aging Effects**: Characters may age rapidly or reverse in age
- **Temporal Loops**: May become stuck repeating the same moments
- **Memory Issues**: Difficulty remembering events within the anomaly
- **Equipment Aging**: Gear may deteriorate or restore to pristine condition

**Navigation Strategies**:
- Document experiences immediately upon entering
- Use non-magical timekeeping methods
- Maintain physical contact between party members
- Leave clear markers for navigation reference
