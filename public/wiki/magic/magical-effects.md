# Magical Effects

### Hellfire
Hellfire differs from normal fire because it is more difficult to put out and it deals dark damage instead of heat. Hellfire does not burn flammable objects like fire does, but without intervention, it will extinguish itself because it does not rely on needing air or material to burn. When suffering the ignited condition from hellfire, the check to put it out is 8 for a helper, and 6 for the creature who is burning.

### Holyfire
Holyfire differs from normal fire because it deals divine damage instead of heat. However, holyfire only deals damage to dark and undead creatures, as well as humanoids that have channeled black magic or done evil. Holyfire does burn material like normal fire, but it is slow to spread and burn, and will eventually go out without some sort of magical enchantment. When a creature is ignited with holyfire, it is just as difficult to put out as normal fire.

### Feyfire
Feyfire differs from normal fire in that it deals aetheric damage. Feyfire is also quite exciting for fey creatures who gain morale equal to the amount of damage dealt to a non-fey creature if they are within a short (10 unit) range of the burning creature.

### Permafrost
Permafrost is ice that doesn't melt without magical intervention. Both hellfire and holyfire will melt permafrost. When a character is frozen by permafrost, they are perfectly preserved and are considered to have the stasis condition. Permafrost is extremely durable and cannot be cracked and destroyed by non-magical means.

### Nullfield
A nullfield is an area where magic is either more difficult or impossible to channel. Basic nullfields will typically add +2 to the required checks of all spells, while complete nullfields make magic impossible. Creating a nullfield is extremely rare and requires a powerful being to do.
