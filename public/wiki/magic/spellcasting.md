# Spellcasting

Magic in Anyventure follows a talent and skill-based system similar to weapons and other abilities. The major difference is channeling spells is the effectiveness of a spell is not influenced by the skill check; it is simply pass or fail. To cast spells, or **channel**, characters must have both the magical knowledge and the specific spell in their repertoire. 


## Casting Mechanics
<div class="triangle-line"></div>

If a player knows the spell, they attempt to channel it by rolling a **spell check**. This is the same as a normal skill check, but using one of the 5 magical skills that represent the [Schools of Magic](/wiki/magic-types).
As with other skill checks, the player rolls a number of dice equal to their talents, and the dice type is equal to their skill.

<br>

The player takes their highest dice from that pool, and that becomes the value of the spell check. **All spells have a required check to channel**. If the spell check is greater than the required check, the spell is cast.

<div class="example-box">
A character with 3 talent and 2 skill in Primal Magic would roll <b>3d8</b> to cast elemental spells.
</div>

### Energy Cost
Channeling spells costs **Energy**. In order to attempt to cast a spell, a player must first spend the energy to do it.

### Spell Failure
If you fail to successfully channel a spell, you cannot attempt to channel that same spell again until you complete a **full rest**. This represents the magical strain and mental fatigue from a failed casting.

### Components
All spells have **components** listed in their descriptions. Components are **not required** for basic spellcasting, but they are used to **charge** spells for enhanced effects. When used for charging, components are always consumed unless you have an appropriate **focus**.

<div class="example-box">
The spell Mend has "silver shards" listed as a component. You can cast Mend normally without silver shards, but if you want to charge it for extra effect, the silver shards will be consumed.
</div>

There are some items called **focuses** that allow you to charge spells without consuming the component. For example, a silver idol focus could replace the need for silver shards when charging spells. However, focuses can break when used, with rules typically built into the item description. 

 

### Charging Spells
Charging is a way to get an extra effect or potency from a spell. Every single spell in AnyventureDX has a **charge effect** listed in the spell description. 

There are a few rules to remember when charging a spell:

- You must declare that you are charging a spell before channeling it
- Charging a spell requires using the component (which is consumed) or an appropriate focus
- Charging a spell increases the required check by +2
- Charging a spell with a focus does not consume the focus, but the focus may break based on its own rules

## Rituals
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Rituals allow a character to channel a spell over a long duration. Casting a spell as a ritual has some differences:

- Rituals require the spell's component (which is consumed unless using a focus)
- A successful ritual results in the spell being automatically charged without requiring an increased required check
- Other characters can assist in the ritual, improving the chance of success

### Assisting Rituals

One of the major benefits of rituals is having other characters be able to help and contribute towards the success of a spell. When taking part in a ritual, there are two options:

<br>

**Roll a spell check**: The character rolls a spell check from the school of magic that the spell is from. If the helper rolls half of the spell's original required check rounded up, they add +1 to the final check. Otherwise, they apply a -1 penalty.

<br>

**Roll a magic check**: The character rolls a magic knowledge check. If the helper rolls equal to or higher than the original required check, they add +1 to the final check. Otherwise, they apply a -1 penalty.

Assisting in rituals makes channeling spells possible that would normally be impossible to complete alone.

<br>

<div class="example-box">
  A Lich Lord wants to raise an army of the dead to bring destruction to the world. This spell requires a check of 22; an impossible feat alone, because although his skill check for channeling a necromancy spell is 4d20, his maximum possible score is only 20. To aid in his success, the Lich gathers his ten strongest generals. They may not excel at necromancy as he does, but they can still contribute with their serviceable Dark Magic checks (3d16). For each check of 11 or higher, they add +1 to the Lich Lordâ€™s final total. Each general has about a two-thirds chance of succeeding and a one-third chance of hindering the ritual. The Lich Lord rolls a 19, so he needs at least three more successes than failures, which is going to be a close call!
</div>


## Managing Spells
<div class="triangle-line"></div>

When a character wants to channel a spell, they must <i>know</i> the spell. By default, a character can only know 10 different spells. This number is known as a character's **spell capacity** and can be increased through modules. If a character wants to acquire a new spell, but they do not have the spell capacity, they can simply forget the spell as if they never knew it.

### Learning New Spells

Learning spells is relatively easy and not that different from channeling a spell normally. In order to learn a new spell, the character must complete the spell's ritual but with an required check that is +2 higher than the spell usually requires. This naturally restricts spells based on the channeler's skill. Naturally, this only applies to the normal <b>subschools</b>. Unless a player has a module or trait that specifically allows them to learn spells from an <b>exotic school</b>, they cannot learn from it.

<div class="example-box">
If a character has a +3 skill in Dark Magic with 2 talents, their maximum possible roll is an 8. This ensures, that without help from an outside source, the character could never learn a spell with a required check higher than 8.
</div>

<br>

There are some caveats to learning spells in this way:

- For spells that require a target, you must have a valid target. This means potentially enlisting a friend to be your test dummy.
- For spells that require a specific focus, like a resurrection spell requiring a corpse that meets certain conditions, you must have that available.
- Despite normal ritual rules, the spell is not charged when you successfully channel it for the first time in order to learn it.
- As with normal rituals, you can also have friends help using the rules in **assisting rituals**.

<div class="note-box">
  For creating a character, it would be a shame to make an archetype that relies heavily on spells but start with none known. For this reason, it is recommended that a GM allow a player to select 5 spells that have a required check 2 less than their maximum magic skill for that school. So, if a character had +1 in one of the magic skills, the maximum they could roll is a 6. This would mean they could learn spells from a normal subschool under that school that has a required check of 4 or lower to start the game with.
