## Character Creation

During character creation:
1. All attributes start at **1**
2. You have **6 points** to distribute
3. Maximum starting attribute is **4**
4. Minimum is **1** (no attribute can be 0)

## How Attributes Work

Attributes determine your **Talent** - how many dice you roll for related skills.

- **1 Attribute** = 1 die (below average)
- **2 Attribute** = 2 dice (average) 
- **3 Attribute** = 3 dice (above average)
- **4 Attribute** = 4 dice (gifted)

Remember: You never make an "attribute check" - you always roll a specific skill under that attribute.
