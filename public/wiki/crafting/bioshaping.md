# Bioshaping

Bioshaping is the craft of manipulating organic materials and living tissue to create items and effects. This rare and often controversial skill allows practitioners to work with biological components in ways that other crafts cannot.

## What You Can Create

Bioshaping allows you to craft:
- **Living Equipment** - Armor and weapons that grow and adapt
- **Biological Components** - Organic parts for other crafting projects
- **Healing Items** - Medical supplies that work with natural biology
- **Modified Organisms** - Enhanced creatures or biological tools
- **Organic Structures** - Buildings and constructs made from living materials
- **Symbiotic Items** - Equipment that bonds with the user

## Specialization Focus

Bioshapers work with monster parts, living tissue, seeds, and other organic materials. They understand biological processes and can manipulate them to create functional items that blur the line between crafted objects and living beings.

## Ethical Considerations

Bioshaping often raises moral and ethical questions, as it involves manipulating life itself. Different cultures and societies have varying acceptance levels for bioshaping practices.
