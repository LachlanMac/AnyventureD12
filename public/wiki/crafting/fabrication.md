# Fabrication

Fabrication is the art of working with metals to create weapons, armor, and metal components. Fabricators are skilled in forging, shaping, and tempering various metals to produce durable and effective equipment.

## What You Can Create

Fabrication allows you to craft:
- **Weapons** - Swords, axes, maces, and other metal weapons
- **Armor** - Mail, plate, and metal protective gear
- **Weapon Components** - Blades, heads, points, and metal weapon parts
- **Tools** - Metal implements, smithing tools, and precision instruments
- **Hardware** - Nails, hinges, locks, and mechanical components

## Specialization Focus

Fabricators are the masters of metalwork, capable of working with everything from common iron to exotic materials like aetherium and starsteel. They understand how different metals behave and can leverage material properties to create superior equipment.

## Material Mastery

Fabrication is deeply tied to the properties of ingots and metals. Each material presents different challenges and benefits:
- **Common Metals** (Iron, Steel) - Reliable and predictable
- **Precious Metals** (Silver, Gold) - Special properties but harder to work
- **Exotic Metals** (Aetherium, Starsteel) - Powerful effects but extremely challenging

### Material Selection
Each weapon component must be crafted from a single type of metal - you cannot mix different metals in the same component. This means fabricators must choose their materials carefully:
- **Common Metals** (Iron, Steel, Copper) - Accessible and predictable for everyday items
- **Precious Metals** (Silver, Gold) - Special properties but higher cost and difficulty
- **Exotic Metals** (Aetherium, Starsteel) - Powerful unique properties but extremely challenging

The choice of material determines both the crafting difficulty and the final properties of the component. Fabricators must weigh cost, availability, and desired effects when selecting materials for their projects.
