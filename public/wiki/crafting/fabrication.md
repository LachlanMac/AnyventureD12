# Fabrication

Fabrication is the art of forging metals and creating weapons and armor. Master fabricators can enhance their creations with special infusions that grant unique properties and bonuses.

## What You Can Create

Fabrication allows you to craft:
- **Melee Weapons** - Swords, axes, maces, spears, and other close-combat weapons
- **Throwing Weapons** - Daggers, throwing axes, javelins, and other projectiles
- **Armor** - Protective gear from simple leather to complex plate

## Infusion System

When crafting weapons or armor, fabricators can attempt to add infusions that enhance the item's properties. Each infusion requires an additional success at the required check. For example, if crafting a sword has a required check of 7, adding one infusion means you need 2 successes at 7 or higher.
