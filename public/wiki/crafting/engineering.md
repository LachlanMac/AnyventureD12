# Engineering

Engineering is the craft of creating mechanical devices, precision tools, and ranged weaponry. Engineers combine wood, metal, and clockwork mechanisms to build functional objects that require technical expertise.

## What You Can Create

Engineering allows you to craft:

### Ranged Weapons
- **Bows** - Shortbow, Longbow, Warbow
- **Crossbows** - Hand Crossbow, Crossbow, Arbalest, Chu-ko-nu
- **Firearms** - Pistol, Musket, Blunderbuss

### Traps & Security
- **Trap Kits** - Shooting Trap, Snare Trap, Explosive Trap, Alarm Trap
- **Locks** - Simple Lock, Advanced Lock
- **Lock Picks** - Lock Pick, Advanced Lock Pick, Automated Lock Pick

### Tools & Devices
- **Optical Tools** - Spyglass, Binoculars
- **Clockwork Devices** - Clockwork Lantern (self-powered lighting)
- **Prosthetic Limbs** - Mechanical replacements for lost limbs

### Components & Ammunition
- **Bow Components** - Light Limbs, Heavy Limbs, Bowstrings
- **Clockwork Parts** - Clockwork Gears, Release Mechanisms
- **Ammunition** - Broadhead Arrows, Bodkin Arrows (crafted in batches of 10)

## Infusion System

When crafting ranged weapons, engineers can attempt to add infusions that enhance the item's properties. Each infusion requires an additional success at the required check. For example, if crafting a longbow has a required check of 6, adding one infusion means you need 2 successes at 6 or higher.

### Ranged Weapon Infusions

| Name | Description | Ingredients |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Reinforced Frame** | Adds +1 primary damage to the weapon | None (technique only) |
| **Precision Balance** | Adds +1 bonus die to attack rolls | Aetherium Shavings |
| **Cobalt Components** | Adds +1 extra damage | Cobalt Ingot |
| **Quick Release** | Reduces energy cost by 1 (minimum 1) | Clockwork Gears |
| **Leather Grip** | Reduces minimum range by 1 tier (minimum 0) | Bundle of Light Leather |
| **Brass Sights** | Increases maximum range by 1 tier | Brass Fittings |
| **Extra Cartridge** | Doubles ammunition capacity | Brass Sheet |
