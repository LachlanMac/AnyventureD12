# Engineering

Engineering is the craft of creating mechanical devices, tools, and structures. Engineers work with wood, metal, and other materials to build functional objects that serve practical purposes.

## What You Can Create

Engineering allows you to craft:
- **Tools and Implements** - Hammers, saws, picks, and specialized equipment
- **Mechanical Devices** - Locks, traps, pulleys, and clockwork mechanisms  
- **Structures** - Bridges, fortifications, siege engines, and buildings
- **Weapon Components** - Shafts, handles, and mechanical parts for weapons
- **Furniture and Fixtures** - Tables, chairs, doors, and architectural elements

## Specialization Focus

Engineers excel at working with wood and creating structural components. They can craft weapon shafts and handles as alternatives to metal fabrication, often producing lighter and more flexible results.
