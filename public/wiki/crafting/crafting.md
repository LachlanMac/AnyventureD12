# Crafting

Crafting in Anyventure allows characters to create items, equipment, and consumables using their skills and gathered materials. Each crafting discipline offers unique possibilities for customization and enhancement through the infusion system.

## Crafting Types

There are six core crafting skills, each specializing in different types of creation:

### Engineering
Creating mechanical devices, tools, and ranged weapons. Engineers work with wood, metal, and complex mechanisms to build crossbows, siege weapons, traps, and intricate devices.

### Fabrication  
Forging metals to create melee weapons, throwing weapons, and armor. Fabricators shape iron, steel, and exotic metals into swords, axes, plate mail, and other combat equipment.

### Alchemy
Brewing potions, elixirs, poisons, explosives, and other consumables. Alchemists combine herbs, minerals, and magical components to create temporary effects and one-use items.

### Cooking
Preparing meals and snacks that provide temporary benefits. Cooks transform ingredients into nourishing food that can enhance abilities, restore resources, or provide resistances.

### Glyphcraft
Inscribing magical symbols to create scrolls, enchantments, and permanent magical effects. Glyphcrafters use special inks and materials to bind magic into written form.

### Biosculpting
Manipulating organic materials and living tissue. Bioshapers work with leather, bone, chitin, and other biological components to create unique items and effects.

## Crafting Checks

To craft an item, you make a skill check using your talent and skill in the appropriate crafting discipline:
- **Talent** (from your attributes) determines how many dice you roll
- **Skill** level determines what type of dice you roll (d4 through d24)
- You need at least one success meeting or exceeding the recipe's difficulty to craft the item

## Infusions

Infusions allow crafters to enhance items during creation by adding special properties. Each infusion requires an additional success at the required check. 

For example, if crafting a sword has a required check of 7:
- Normal sword: 1 success at 7+
- Sword with one infusion: 2 successes at 7+  
- Sword with two infusions: 3 successes at 7+

You can add multiple infusions to a single item, but each infusion must be unique - you cannot stack the same infusion multiple times.
