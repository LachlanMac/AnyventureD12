# Alchemy

Alchemy is the science of brewing potions, creating chemicals, and mixing magical compounds. Alchemists combine various ingredients to produce consumable items with temporary or permanent effects.

## What You Can Create

Alchemy allows you to craft:
- **Healing Potions** - Restore health, energy, and resolve
- **Enhancement Elixirs** - Temporary stat boosts and special abilities
- **Poisons and Toxins** - Harmful substances for weapons or direct use
- **Magical Compounds** - Reagents and components for other crafts
- **Utility Mixtures** - Adhesives, solvents, and specialized chemicals
- **Consumable Items** - Various one-use items with magical or chemical effects

## Specialization Focus

Alchemists work primarily with herbs, minerals, and magical components to create liquid and powder-based items. They understand the interactions between different substances and can combine them to achieve specific effects.

## Ingredient Mastery

Alchemy relies heavily on understanding ingredient properties and combinations. Rare herbs, exotic minerals, and magical components can produce more powerful effects but require greater skill to work with safely.
