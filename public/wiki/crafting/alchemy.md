# Alchemy

Alchemy is the art of brewing potions, creating elixirs, and mixing poisons. Master alchemists can enhance their creations with special infusions that modify potency, duration, and other properties.

## What You Can Create

Alchemy allows you to craft:
- **Elixirs** - Healing drafts and restorative compounds
- **Potions** - Temporary enhancement effects and magical transformations
- **Poisons** - Harmful substances for weapons or direct application

## Infusion System

When crafting alchemical items, alchemists can attempt to add infusions that enhance the item's properties. Each infusion requires an additional success at the required check. For example, if brewing a potion has a required check of 10, adding one infusion means you need 2 successes at 10 or higher.
