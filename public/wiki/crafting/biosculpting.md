# Biosculpting

Biosculpting is the art of grafting biological tissue and organs from creatures into living subjects. Master biosculptors can harvest body parts from slain creatures and surgically implant them, granting the recipient new abilities and enhancements at the cost of physical and mental strain. Additionally, they can sculpt spores from fungi to have certain effects and deploy them in battle.


## What You Can Create

Biosculpting allows you to perform:
- **Eye Implants** - Replace natural eyes with harvested eyes from creatures
- **Hand Implants** - Replace hands with claws, talons, or other appendages
- **Arm Implants** - Replace entire arms with monstrous limbs
- **Leg Implants** - Replace legs for enhanced mobility or strength
- **Skin Implants** - Graft scales, hide, or other protective coverings
- **Internal Implants** - Replace or add internal organs for various benefits

## Implant Mechanics

By default, biosculptors can only harvest and install implants from beasts, monsters, and humanoids. Certain advanced techniques allow working with more exotic creature types.

All implants have inherent costs and risks:

### Base Costs
Each implant type has standard penalties:
- **Pain Penalty** - Ongoing discomfort (reduces max Resolve)
- **Health Penalty** - Reduces max Health
- **Resolve Penalty** - Reduces max Resolve
- **Rejection Check** - Required check for Endurance to avoid rejection

### Rejection
After implantation, the recipient must make endurance checks after each full rest to see if the implant is rejected or accepted. The implant can only be used after 3 successes. If 3 failures occur before the 3 successes, the implant is rejected and destroyed.

### Creature Parts
The tier and type of the creature the body part was harvested from determines the implant's benefits. There are several stock predefined creature parts listed under the body parts section of items. 


### Implant Infusions

| Name | Description | Ingredients |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Compatibility Serum | Reduces rejection required check by 2 | Troll blood, alchemist's spirits |
| Pain Dampener | Reduces pain penalty by 1 | Valerian root, poppy extract |
| Health Restorative | Negates the health penalty | Regenerative tissue sample |
| Resolve Stabilizer | Negates the resolve penalty | Calming herbs, spirit essence |
| Potency Booster | Enhances the implant's primary effect by one tier (Champion acts as Elite, etc.) | Rare biological catalyst |


## Harvesting Body Parts

Body parts must be harvested from recently deceased creatures. The quality and power of the part depends on the creature's tier. A biosculptor can harvest appropriate parts from any creature they encounter, though rarer and more powerful creatures yield more valuable components.

Harvested parts should be preserved and used within a reasonable timeframe, or properly stored using alchemical preservatives.

## Sporecraft

Sporecraft is the art of cultivating and programming fungal spores to create potent area effects. Unlike implants which are permanent modifications, spores create temporary clouds that affect all creatures within their radius. Fungus can be rare in the world, and how available it is will often be up to the GM and the setting. 

### Fungus Quality Tiers

The quality of the base fungus determines how difficult it is to craft spore pods:

- **Tier 3 Fungus** (Exceptional) - Required check of 5
- **Tier 2 Fungus** (Quality) - Required check of 7
- **Tier 1 Fungus** (Basic) - Required check of 9

### Spore Cloud Mechanics

A character can release a spore cloud by taking the Use action. When they do, the spore cloud spreads with the following defaults:

- **Default Radius**: 2 units
- **Default Duration**: 2 rounds
- **Trigger**: Creatures that start their turn within the cloud are affected
- **Limitation**: Each creature can only be affected by each spore infusion type once per day (unless modified by the Mutation infusion)

### Sporecraft Infusions

When crafting spores, you can add infusions to modify their effects. Each infusion requires an additional success at the required check. For example, if crafting a spore pod has a required check of 5, adding one infusion means you need 2 successes at 5 or higher.

| Infusion Name | Effect | Additional Use | Ingredient |
|---------------|--------|----------------|------------|
| **Regenerative Spores** | Creatures who start their turn in the cloud regenerate 1 health. | +1 health regenerated | - |
| **Pleasure Spores** | Creatures who start their turn in the cloud gain 1 resolve. | +1 resolve gained | - |
| **Calming Spores** | Creatures who start their turn in the cloud gain a -1 bonus on checks to recover from mental conditions until the start of their next turn. | Additional -1 bonus | - |
| **Energizing Spores** | Creatures who start their turn in the cloud regenerate 1 additional energy. | +1 energy regenerated | - |
| **Blinding Spores** | Creatures who start their turn in the cloud become blinded until the start of their next turn if they fail an endurance check of 4. | Required check increased by 1 | - |
| **Choking Spores** | Creatures who start their turn in the cloud become muted until the start of their next turn if they fail an endurance check of 4. | Required check increased by 1 | - |
| **Confusion Spores** | Creatures who start their turn in the cloud become confused until the start of their next turn if they fail a resilience check of 4. | Required check increased by 1 | - |
| **Maddening Spores** | Creatures who start their turn in the cloud become maddened until the start of their next turn if they fail a resilience check of 4. | Required check increased by 1 | - |
| **Toxic Spores** | Creatures who start their turn in the cloud take 3 toxic damage if they fail an endurance check of 4. | +2 damage and required check increased by 1 | - |
| **Flammable** | If the spore cloud is exposed to fire, it explodes, dealing 8 heat damage to all creatures in the area. Creatures can make a defense check of 5 to take half damage. The explosion destroys the spore cloud. | +1 to required check and +4 damage | Pinch of Sulfur |
| **Potent Cultivation** | Increases the tier of the spore by 1 (Tier 1 becomes Tier 2, Tier 2 becomes Tier 3). | Cannot be used more than once | Vial of Purified Blood |
| **Extended Duration** | Doubles the duration of the cloud. | Cannot be used more than once | Amber |
| **Expanded Radius** | Doubles the radius of the cloud. | Cannot be used more than once | Pinch of Saltpeter |
| **Mutation** | Creatures can be affected by this spore more than once per day. | Cannot be used more than once | Vial of Caustic Lye |

### Crafting Spores

With the appropriate fungal materials and infusion ingredients, you can create specialized spore pods during a full rest. By default, a character can craft one sporecraft recipe per full rest. Some module options allow you to craft additional spore pods during the same rest period.
