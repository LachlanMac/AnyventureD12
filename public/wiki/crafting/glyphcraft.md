# Glyphcraft

Glyphcraft is the art of inscribing magical symbols, creating enchantments, and crafting scrolls and magical inscriptions. Glyphcrafters bridge the gap between mundane crafting and pure magic.

## What You Can Create

Glyphcraft allows you to craft:
- **Spell Scrolls** - Single-use items containing prepared spells
- **Enchanted Items** - Equipment with permanent magical properties
- **Magical Inscriptions** - Symbols and glyphs with various effects
- **Wards and Protections** - Defensive magical markings
- **Ritual Components** - Items used in magical ceremonies
- **Magical Texts** - Spellbooks, tomes, and instructional materials

## Specialization Focus

Glyphcrafters work with magical inks, precious metals, gemstones, and enchanted materials. They must understand both the physical craft of inscription and the magical principles that make their creations function.

## Magical Integration

Glyphcraft uniquely combines crafting skills with magical knowledge. Many recipes require both crafting ability and understanding of specific magical schools to complete successfully.
