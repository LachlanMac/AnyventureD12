# Glyphcraft

Glyphcraft is the art of inscribing magical symbols to create enchantments and magical items. Glyphcrafters use special inks infused with metal shavings to imbue items with permanent magical properties.

## What You Can Create

Glyphcraft allows you to craft:
- **Runes** - Magical inscriptions that grant permanent enchantments
- **Wands & Staves** - Focus items for spellcasters
- **Spell Scrolls** - Single-use items containing prepared spells

## Infusion System

When inscribing magical items, glyphcrafters can add infusions using different metal shavings mixed into their inks. Each infusion requires an additional success at the required check. The type of metal shaving determines the enchantment effect.
