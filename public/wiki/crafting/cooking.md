# Cooking

Cooking is the art of preparing food that provides nourishment and temporary benefits. A skilled cook can transform simple ingredients into meals that enhance abilities and provide lasting effects.

## What You Can Create

Cooking allows you to craft:
- **Simple Meals** - Basic sustenance with minimal benefits
- **Hearty Meals** - Filling meals that count as 2 regular meals
- **Fine Meals** - Expertly prepared dishes with enhanced effects
- **Hearty Fine Meals** - The pinnacle of culinary arts

## Infusion System

When preparing meals, cooks can enhance their dishes with spices that act as infusions. Unlike other crafts, spice infusions don't require additional successes - they are ingredients that enhance all effects in the meal.

### Culinary Infusions (Spices)

| Name | Description | Effect |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Common Spices | Salt, pepper, basic herbs | +1 to all meal effects |
| Exotic Spices | Saffron, rare peppers, imported seasonings | +2 to all meal effects |
| Magical Spices | Enchanted herbs, elemental essences | +3 to all meal effects |

## Ingredient Types

### Meal Base (Protein Sources)
The "base" of a meal consists of high-quality protein sources that enhance the effects of other ingredients. Meals do not require a base, but they are much more effective with one:
- **Meat** - From various creatures
- **Fish** - Fresh or preserved seafood  
- **Eggs** - From birds or other creatures
- **Mushrooms** - Hearty varieties with meat-like properties

Each base ingredient comes in different quality tiers:
- **Tier 1**: Standard quality (+1 to all meal effects)
- **Tier 2**: Premium quality (+2 to all meal effects)
- **Tier 3**: Exceptional quality (+3 to all meal effects)

### Supporting Ingredients
Supporting ingredients provide specific benefits:
- **Root Vegetables** (Beet/Potato/Carrot): +1 health after the next full rest
- **Squash**: Minimum endurance check result becomes 1
- **Beans/Legumes**: Minimum resilience check result becomes 1
- **Peppers**: +1 cold mitigation
- **Cucumbers**: +1 heat mitigation
- **Leafy Greens** (Spinach/Cabbage/Lettuce): Minimum concentration check result becomes 1
- **Cheese**: +1 morale

## Meal Types

### Simple Meal
A simple meal is the easiest meal to make and can contain any combination of ingredients. It counts as 1 meal for the day but cannot benefit from spice infusions.

- **Requirements**: Any 2 ingredients
- **Required Cooking Check**: 2

<div class="example-box">
A chef makes a simple meal with a tier 2 cut of meat and peppers. Peppers grant +1 cold mitigation after eating them and the tier 2 meat adds +2 to all meal effects. This means the individual that ate the food gains +3 cold mitigation.  
</div>

### Hearty Meal  
A hearty meal adds a grain such as rice, oats or bread, making it more filling. It counts as eating 2 meals and can sustain most creatures. Hearty meals can benefit from spice infusions.

- **Requirements**: Any 2 ingredients, a grain, and optional spices
- **Required Cooking Check**: 4

<div class="example-box">
A chef makes a hearty meal with tier 3 fish, beans, rice, and exotic spices. Beans set the minimum resilience check to 1, the tier 3 fish adds +3, and the exotic spices add +2 more. The character's minimum resilience check becomes 6, and they count as having eaten 2 meals.
</div>

### Fine Meal
A fine meal requires a base and 2 additional secondary ingredients. It counts as eating one meal but requires the use of spice infusions. 

- **Requirements**: Any base, 2 additional unique ingredients, and required spices
- **Required Cooking Check**: 6

<div class="example-box">
A chef creates a fine meal with tier 2 mushrooms, peppers, squash, and common spices. The character gains +4 cold mitigation (1 base + 2 from mushrooms + 1 from spices) AND a minimum endurance check of 4 (1 base + 2 from mushrooms + 1 from spices).
</div>

### Hearty Fine Meal
A hearty fine meal requires a base and 2 additional secondary ingredients, and a grain. It has the same rules as a fine meal, but benefits from adding a grain to make it count as having eaten 2 meals. 

- **Requirements**: Any base, 2 additional unique ingredients, a grain, and required spices
- **Required Cooking Check**: 8

<div class="example-box">
A chef prepares a hearty fine meal with tier 3 meat, cucumbers, beans, oats, and exotic spices. The character gains +6 heat mitigation (1 base + 3 from meat + 2 from spices) AND a minimum resilience check of 6 (1 base + 3 from meat + 2 from spices). This counts as 2 meals.
</div>

## Meal Rules

All effects last until the end of the day or until the party eats again. Effects from meals do not stack and override each other immediately after finishing the new meal. A character can only gain a resource such as resolve, morale or health once per day by consuming a meal.
