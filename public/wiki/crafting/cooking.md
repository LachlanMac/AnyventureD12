# Cooking

Cooking is the art of preparing food that provides nourishment and temporary benefits. A skilled cook can transform simple ingredients into meals that enhance abilities and provide lasting effects.

## Understanding Meal Components

### Meal Base (Protein Sources)
The "base" of a meal consists of high-quality protein sources that enhance the effects of other ingredients. Meals do not require a base, but they are much more effective with one.:
- **Meat** - From various creatures
- **Fish** - Fresh or preserved seafood  
- **Eggs** - From birds or other creatures
- **Mushrooms** - Hearty varieties with meat-like properties

Each base ingredient comes in different quality tiers:
- **Tier 1**: Standard quality (+1 to all meal effects)
- **Tier 2**: Premium quality (+2 to all meal effects)
- **Tier 3**: Exceptional quality (+3 to all meal effects)

### Supporting Ingredients
Supporting ingredients provide a variety of benefits and effects. Some of these are meaningless without an effective meal base or spices. 

- **Root Vegetables** (Beet/Potato/Carrot): +1 health after the next full rest
- **Squash**: Minimum endurance check result becomes 1
- **Beans/Legumes**: Minimum resilience check result becomes 1
- **Peppers**: +1 cold mitigation
- **Cucumbers**: +1 heat mitigation
- **Leafy Greens** (Spinach/Cabbage/Lettuce): Minimum concentration check result becomes 1
- **Cheese**: +1 morale



### Spices
Enhance ALL effects in a meal by adding a flat bonus:
- **Tier 1 Spices** (salt, pepper, common herbs): +1 to all effects
- **Tier 2 Spices** (saffron, exotic peppers): +2 to all effects
- **Tier 3 Spices** (magical or extremely rare spices): +3 to all effects

## Meal Types

### Simple Meal

A simple meal is the easiest meal to make and can contain any combination of ingredients. It counts as 1 meal for the day but cannot benefit from using spices.

- **Requirements**: Any 2 ingredients
- **Required Cooking Check**: 2


<div class="example-box">
A chef makes a simple meal with a tier 2 cut of meat and peppers. Peppers grant +1 cold mitigation after eating them and the tier 2 meat adds +2 to all meal effects. This means the individual that ate the food gains +3 cold mitigation.  
</div>

<div class="example-box">
A chef makes a simple meal with cucumbers and spinach. Cucumbers provide +1 heat mitigation and spinach is a leafy green, effecting the minimum concentration check a character could roll. Because there was no base used, the concentration bonus is meaningless because 1 is already the lowest that can be rolled. If the chef decides to add tier 1 spices, the benefit would be increased to +2 heat mitigation and the minimum concentration check they could roll becomes a 2.  
</div>

### Hearty Meal  

A hearty meal adds a grain such as rice, oats or bread, making it more filling. It counts as eating 2 meals and can sustain most creatures. Hearty meals can benefit from spices.

- **Requirements**: Any 2 ingredients, a grain, and optional spices.
- **Required Cooking Check**: 4

<div class="example-box">
A chef makes a hearty meal with tier 3 fish, beans, rice, and tier 2 spices. Beans set the minimum resilience check to 1, the tier 3 fish adds +3, and the tier 2 spices add +2 more. The character's minimum resilience check becomes 6, and they count as having eaten 2 meals.
</div>

<div class="example-box">
A chef makes a hearty meal with cheese, root vegetables, and bread (no base or spices). Cheese provides +1 morale and root vegetables provide +1 health after the next full rest. Without a base or spices, these are the only benefits, but it still counts as 2 meals.
</div>

### Fine Meal

A fine meal requires a base and 2 additional secondary ingredients. It counts as eating one meal but requires the use of spices. 

- **Requirements**: Any base, 2 additional unique ingredients, and required spices.
- **Required Cooking Check**: 6

<div class="example-box">
A chef creates a fine meal with tier 2 mushrooms, peppers, squash, and tier 1 spices. The character gains +4 cold mitigation (1 base + 2 from mushrooms + 1 from spices) AND a minimum endurance check of 4 (1 base + 2 from mushrooms + 1 from spices).
</div>

<div class="example-box">
A chef prepares a fine meal with tier 1 eggs, leafy greens, cheese, and tier 3 spices. The character gains a minimum concentration check of 5 (1 base + 1 from eggs + 3 from spices) AND +5 morale (1 base + 1 from eggs + 3 from spices).
</div>

### Hearty Fine Meal

A hearty fine meal requires a base and 2 additional secondary ingredients, and a grain. It has the same rules as a fine meal, but benefits from adding a grain to make it count as having eaten 2 meals. 

- **Requirements**: Any base, 2 additional unique ingredients, a grain, and required spices.
- **Required Cooking Check**: 8

<div class="example-box">
A chef prepares a hearty fine meal with tier 3 meat, cucumbers, beans, oats, and tier 2 spices. The character gains +6 heat mitigation (1 base + 3 from meat + 2 from spices) AND a minimum resilience check of 6 (1 base + 3 from meat + 2 from spices). This counts as 2 meals.
</div>

<div class="example-box">
A master chef creates a hearty fine meal with tier 2 fish, root vegetables, peppers, rice, and tier 3 spices. The character gains +6 health after their next full rest (1 base + 2 from fish + 3 from spices) AND +6 cold mitigation (1 base + 2 from fish + 3 from spices). This counts as 2 meals.</div>


## Meal Rules

All effects last until the end of the day or until the party eats again. Effects from meals do not stack and override each other immediately after finishing the new meal. A character can only gain a resource such as resolve, morale or health once per day by consuming a meal.
