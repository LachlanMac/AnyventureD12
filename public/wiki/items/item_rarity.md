## Rarity Tiers

All items in Anyventure have a rarity field. These are suggestions rather than the rule. It is perfectly reasonable that some world maybe have different resources than others. Rarity is mostly a suggestion on how 'available' an item is.

### Common
The most basic of items you would expect to find in any relevant shop. It should be a rare occurrence that an herbalist shop would not have common herbal ingredients in stock.

### Uncommon
Uncommon resources and items may not be available in smaller villages, but could be found in larger towns and definitely bigger cities.

### Rare
Rare resources are not likely to be found in any settlements besides large cities. While there will certain be cases of rare items existing in unexpected places, it would not be the rule.

### Epic
Epic items are prized possessions. A very prominent merchant may have 1 or 2 epic items but they will not be likely to part with them and they will be extremely well guarded.

### Legendary  
Legendary items are extremely rare and not normally attainable. The major heroes and rulers of the world may have a legendary item or two, but these are not items you would see for sale under normal circumstances.

### Artifact
Artifacts are so rare that they most likely wouldn't be encountered during normal play. These types of items are wielded by entities or lost to history. Artifacts can be extremely powerful and dangerous.
