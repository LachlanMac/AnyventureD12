# Equipment & Items

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

## Weapons
Weapons are divided by complexity and type:

- **Simple Melee**: Daggers, clubs, spears
- **Simple Ranged**: Shortbows, slings, hand crossbows
- **Complex Melee**: Longswords, greataxes, rapiers
- **Complex Ranged**: Longbows, warbows, arbalests

Generally, complex weapons are more versatile than simple weapons and can deal more damage at the cost of requiring energy to use. They also require more training to be talented with as all characters start off with a talent in simple weapons.

### Weapon Categories
Weapons also have categories which determines what types of actions they can benefit from. 

- **Slashing**: Long swords, axes, whips
- **Piercing**: Daggers, short swords, spears
- **Blunt**: Hammers, staves and clubs
- **Ranged**: Bows, throwing weapons, slings
- **Magic**: Staves and Wands that channel one of the five schools of magic (Black, Primal, Divine, Mysticism, Meta). These weapons    
   typically require energy to use their magical properties but can often be used as simple melee weapons as well.



Some weapons can have more than one category, with different damage and energy costs.

<div class="example-box">
    A glaive is a versatile complex weapon that has both a slashing and blunt category. The slashing category is much more effective, as that is the main mechanism in which the weapon deals damage. It can hit creatures at a longer range than most melee weapons and deals 6 damage with 4 extra damage (6/4). A glaive can also be used to bludgeon someone with the other end in the same way someone would swing a staff. This damage is much less (3/3), but it allows the user to use special actions that require a blunt weapon.
</div>

<div class="example-box">
    A flame staff is an item that has a unique magic property on it. Primarily, it allows the wielder to use their primal magic skill to make a ranged attack that deals heat damage (4/3) and consumes 1 energy. The secondary property allows it to be used just like a normal staff by making a simple melee attack that requires no energy, is of the blunt category, and deals 4 damage and 2 extra damage (4/2).

## Shields

Shields do not require any special skill to use. They are useful for characters who rely on deflection to protect themselves from attacks. It is much more effective to block an arrow with a shield than it is a weapon.

### Light
Normally, when being attacked by a ranged weapon, a character that uses the deflection as a defense check must halve their result and round down.

With a light shield, this penalty is removed and the shield user uses the value of their deflection check against range attacks that target a single creature.

<div class="example-box">
A fighter with a long sword and no shield is attacked by an archer. The archer rolls a 4d8 for their attack and rolls a 8, 5, 4 and 3. The fighter makes a deflection check of 2d10 and rolls an 8 as their highest value. Because they are defending against a ranged attack, the 8 becomes a 4. In effect, the 8, 5 and 4 all hit. The archer's weapon has 5 damage and 3 extra damage (5/3), dealing a total of 11 damage (5 + 3 + 3).
</div>

<div class="example-box">
Consider the previous example where the fighter has a light shield; instead of being halved, their 8 manages to defend against the 5, 4 and 3. Only the 8 hits causing the total damage to be 5 from the attack.
</div>

### Heavy
Heavy shields have the same bonus as light shields against ranged attacks, but the effect also extends to area attacks. Heavy shields are very effective for defense, but are often cumbersome to wield in battle.

<div class="example-box">
An enemy demolitionist throws a fire bomb at the party which requires a defense check of 6 to avoid. The fighter with the light shield in the following example still must halve their defense check against the area attack. Even though they roll a 10, that check is halved to a 5. If the fighter was using a heavy shield, they completely avoid the attack because their 10 beats the 6.

## Worn Equipment

Many pieces of equipment are effective at increasing protection and mitigating damage. The only limit to equipment is the slot that it occupies; a character can only benefit from a single item in each slot, except for accessories.

- **Body**: A specialized (non-clothing) piece of equipment that offers some benefit. This can be anything from a magical robe to plate armor.
- **Head**: A piece of equipment that is worn on the head such as a helmet, hood or crown.
- **Cloak**: A protective piece of clothing worn on the back. The most basic cloaks protect against the weather or help insulate the wearer.
- **Hands**: Gloves and gauntlets that are used to protect the hands.
- **Feet**: Boots, shoes and greaves that protect the lower leg and feet.
- **Accessories**: Rings, amulets, bracers, belts and anything in between.

<div class="note-box">
The default rule for the number of accessories a character can benefit from is 2, but this can be adjusted.
