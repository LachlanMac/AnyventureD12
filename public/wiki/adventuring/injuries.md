# Injuries

Injuries represent lasting physical and mental trauma that characters can sustain during their adventures. These wounds go beyond simple hit point damage and can have lasting mechanical and narrative effects.

## Cosmetic Injuries

Cosmetic injuries are minor wounds that have primarily narrative impact with minimal mechanical effects. They serve as visible reminders of past battles and adventures without significantly impacting a character's abilities.

## Physical Injuries

Physical injuries represent bodily harm that causes pain and requires time to heal. To recover from a physical injury, you must complete a full rest while at full health and make an Endurance check against the injury's recovery threshold. Each failed recovery attempt reduces the threshold by 1, making the injury progressively easier to overcome with rest and care.

## Mental Injuries

Mental injuries represent psychological trauma that causes stress and affects your mental state. To recover from a mental injury, you must complete a full rest while at full resolve and make a Resilience check against the injury's recovery threshold. Each failed recovery attempt reduces the threshold by 1, allowing gradual recovery through proper rest and mental care.

## Missing Parts

Missing parts represent the permanent loss of body parts that fundamentally change how a character functions. These injuries cannot be healed through normal means and often require prosthetics or powerful magic to restore.
