# Pain & Stress

Pain and Stress represent the accumulated physical and mental suffering a character endures. Pain comes from physical injuries and trauma, while Stress comes from mental injuries and psychological trauma. Both are automatically calculated and apply different effects when certain thresholds are met.

## Pain
<div class="triangle-line"></div>

Pain represents physical duress a character is under and is an accumulation of either missing health, injuries or other effects.

### Pain Thresholds

| Pain Level | Range | Effects |
|------------|-------|---------|
| Mild Pain | 1-5 | No effect. |
| Moderate Pain | 6-10 | +1 penalty die on all rolls. |
| Severe Pain | 11-15 | +2 penalty dice on all rolls. Cannot benefit from Favorable rest. Morale is set to 0 and you cannot benefit from morale. |
| Critical Pain | 16+ | +2 penalty dice on all rolls. In combat, at the start of your turn, make an Endurance check of 4 or fall unconscious. Cannot benefit from Favorable rest. Morale is set to 0 and you cannot benefit from morale. |

### Calculating Pain

Pain is calculated from multiple sources:

#### Injuries
- **Cosmetic Injuries**: 0 pain
- **Minor Physical Injuries**: 1 pain each
- **Major Physical Injuries**: 2 pain each
- **Severe Physical Injuries**: 3 pain each

#### Health Status
- **Below Half Health**: +2 pain
- **Below 5 Health**: +4 pain

#### Example

<div class="example-box">
Kael the mercenary has taken a beating in a skirmish with bandits. He has a maximum health of 20 but is currently at 3 health after a brutal fight. He has one minor physical injury and one major physical injury from the battle. His pain calculation is: 1 (minor injury) + 2 (major injury) + 4 (below 5 health) = 7 total pain, placing him at <strong>Moderate Pain</strong>. Every movement is becoming difficult as the adrenaline wears off.

## Stress
<div class="triangle-line"></div>

Stress represents mental and psychological duress a character is under and is an accumulation of either missing resolve, mental injuries or other effects.

### Stress Thresholds

| Stress Level | Range | Effects |
|------------|-------|---------|
| Mild Stress | 1-5 | No effect. |
| Moderate Stress | 6-10 | +1 penalty die on all rolls. |
| Severe Stress | 11-15 | +2 penalty dice on all rolls. Cannot benefit from Favorable rest. Morale is set to 0 and you cannot benefit from gaining morale. |
| Critical Stress | 16+ | +2 penalty dice on all rolls. In combat, at the start of your turn, make a Resilience check of 4 or become Broken. Cannot benefit from Favorable rest. Morale is set to 0 and you cannot benefit from morale. |

### Calculating Stress

Stress is calculated from multiple sources:

#### Injuries
- **Minor Mental Injuries**: 1 stress each
- **Major Mental Injuries**: 2 stress each
- **Severe Mental Injuries**: 3 stress each

#### Resolve Status
- **Below Half Resolve**: +2 stress
- **Below 3 Resolve**: +4 stress

#### Example

<div class="example-box">
Lyra the scholar has been delving into forbidden texts and witnessed unspeakable horrors in an ancient crypt. She has a maximum resolve of 12 but is currently at just 2 resolve after days of psychological torment. She has one severe mental injury and two major mental injuries she picked up from her time in the depths. Her stress calculation is: 3 (severe injury) + 2 (major injury) + 2 (major injury) + 4 (below 3 resolve) = 11 total stress, placing her at <strong>Severe Stress</strong>. She can barely distinguish reality from nightmare anymore and struggles to make even simple decisions.

## Managing Pain & Stress
<div class="triangle-line"></div>

### Natural Recovery
Both pain and stress decrease as their underlying causes are addressed:
- Healing injuries removes their associated pain or stress
- Recovering health and resolve to get over thresholds
- Treatment from modules or specialized skills that reduce stress or pain

### Substances
Certain substances can temporarily suppress pain or stress, allowing characters to function despite severe trauma. Painkillers can either reduce or completely eliminate pain on a temporary basis, letting wounded characters push through injuries that would otherwise incapacitate them. Alcohol and depressants can numb mental anguish and reduce stress, providing short-term relief from psychological trauma. Euphoric substances can similarly suppress stress by inducing artificial feelings of well-being and calm. However, all of these substances carry the risk of dependency, with repeated use potentially leading to addiction. See the [Substances](substances) page for complete details on available substances, their effects, and dependency mechanics.
