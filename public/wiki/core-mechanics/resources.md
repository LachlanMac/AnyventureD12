# Resources

All characters have resources that they need to manage.

## Health

All characters have health which is an abstraction of how close to death they are. By default, a player character has 20 health.


## Resolve
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Resolve is a representation fo mental health. By default, a player character has 20 resolve.

## Morale
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Morale is a buffer that sits between Health and Resolve. If there is ever a situation where a character would take damage to either resource, the damage would be first done to morale. A player by default has 0 morale, but can store a maximum of 20.

## Energy
