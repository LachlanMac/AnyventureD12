# Resources

All characters have resources that they need to manage. These include Health, Resolve, Morale and Energy.

## Health
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
All characters have health which is an abstraction of how close to death they are. By default, a player character has 20 health. This number is able to be improved by certain traits in modules as well as equipment.


### Recovering Health
Losing and managing health is a large part of AnyventureDX. Character's have several ways of recovering health, but the most simple is **resting**. When a character completes a full rest with favorable conditions, such as staying in an inn or a safe and sheltered location, they recover 4 health. If they complete a full rest in unfavorable conditions, like a tent or sleeping on the ground, they recover 2 health.

There are also several ways to recover health:
- Potions
- Treatment from someone with the Medic Module
- Magic
- Items and Skills that impact your regeneration rate

### Reaching 0 Health
When a character reaches 0 health, they are not immediately dead. A player can have their character and continue to fight on, although at great risk using their resolve. At the start of their turn where they have 0 health, a player can spend 2 resolve to continue to take a turn as normal. This is considered being in **lifeline**. 

When a character takes more than 5 damage while in lifeline, they must roll on the lifeline table:

### Lifeline Table (Roll 1d8)

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Death Check** - You make a death check by rolling a d12. On a 7 or lower, you die. Otherwise, you fall unconscious. |
| 2 | **Lost Limb** - One of your limbs is either severed or mangled beyond repair without high level magic. |
| 3 | **Lingering Injury** - You receive an injury that is not permanent but will take some time to heal. This can include losing eyesight, hearing or damaging a limb. |
| 4 | **Severe Wound** - You receive a wound so dire, you will never truly recover. Your maximum health is permanently lowered by 1 and gain the bleeding condition.|
| 5 | **Cosmetic Injury** - You receive a cosmetic injury such as a massive gash, severed ear or broken horn. |
| 6 | **Fall Unconscious** - You are unable to stay conscious and drop where you stand. |
| 7 | **Fall Prone** - You are unable to stay on your feet. If you attempt to stand back up you must make a resilience or endurance check of 15 or higher. |
| 8 | **Nothing Happens** - Adrenaline and luck carry you through as you shrug off the blow |


### Going Unconscious
When a character falls unconscious due to having 0 health, they will regain consciousness in 1 hour if they gain at least 10 health back. Otherwise, they use the normal rules for recovering from being unconscious listed in [Conditions](/wiki/conditions).

## Resolve

Resolve is a representation of mental health. By default, a player character has 20 resolve. There are many ways to gain and lose resolve during a campaign, and much of that will vary by the type of game you are playing in. A game with horror elements may
see resolve being tested much more often. Likewise, a game with lots of combats with opponents who employ skills and spells that deal psychic damage will also test resolve. 

### Recovering Resolve
Recovering resolve is not always cut or dry. Unlike health, players do not recover resolve over time and instead must actively see out activities or consumables that help them mentally recover. Consumables are the easiest way to recover resolve; anything from a homecooked meal to dangerous, addictive substances. 

### Reaching 0 Resolve
When a character reaches 0 resolve, they become vulnerable to several mental breaks after gaining the Broken [Condition](/wiki/conditions). 



## Morale

Morale is a buffer that sits between Health and Resolve. If there is ever a situation where a character would take damage to either resource, the damage would be first done to morale. A player character by default has 0 morale, but can store a maximum of 20.



## Energy
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Energy is a short term resource that determines how much a character can exert on a single round of combat. By default, a character has 5 energy and regenerates 3 per turn.

A character can use more energy than they have at the risk of becoming winded. When a character has negative energy, they must immediately make an endurance check of 10 or become winded. The winded condition and it's effects are described in [Condition](/wiki/conditions).
