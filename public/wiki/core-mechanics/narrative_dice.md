# Narrative Dice

Narrative dice are a tool employed by the GM to resolve narrative situations where using a game mechanic would be too difficult or unrealistic. Sometimes a scene presents a situation that the rules donâ€™t cover, or the GM simply wants to add flavor without forcing a skill check. In those moments the **Narrative Dice** is used. The GM rolls a d100 (or another percentile die) and interprets the result as a narrative outcome.

While it isn't required, the GM should state that they are making a narrative roll and explain what the results will mean before rolling. This serves two purposes: it informs the characters of the risk and makes the decision seem less arbitrary.

### When to Use

Narrative Dice should be used when any amount of randomness helps drive the story forward or creates/enhances a scenario. Narrative dice should be mostly used in response to a player's question about the current scenario, especially when it involves the question of 'How Many?'. This dice should not be used when the randomness is completely unexpected without any foreshadowing. Having a character die to due to something they had no control over is not a fun resolution for a player. 

<div class="example-box">
The party is faced with the challenge of a ravine, but there is a rickety wooden bridge passing over it. The GM describes it as looking very old and dry-rotted. The party decides to press on regardless, but to do so one at a time. For each player, the GM rolls a narrative dice to see what happens when they cross the bridge. Mentally, the GM decides that a 5 or less is going to cause the bridge to completely fail and anything else under 20 is going to introduce a challenge for the crossing character, such as a broken board, or a gust of wind for them to brace against. The result of this narrative will create a situation where the character will have to roll actual skill checks to attempt to resolve the situation.

<div class="example-box">
The party find themselves in an armory with several old, rusted weapons. One of the players has a blacksmith type character, who while not interested in the financial value of the weapons, plans to repurpose them. The GM didn't really plan for this, so when the player asks how many usable weapons there are, the GM uses a narrative check to decide, mentally deciding that for each 10 on the narrative dice, they will say there are 2 weapons in good enough shape to be reused. The GM rolls a 47, and says that there are 8 weapons that can be used and repurposed.

<div class="example-box">
The party is in combat against a hulking beast, with two characters standing adjacent to it and an archer is a short distance away, but still within the beasts movement. The beast isn't intelligence and does not employ tactics, so how does the GM decide who which character will be attacked? The creature, not being smart, would attack randomly, but most likely target the closest targets. The GM decides mentally that a 20 or less, the beast will risk attack of opportunities to charge the archer. On anything else, it will attack one of the close characters at an even rate, so 21-60 will be the first character, and 61+ will be the other.
