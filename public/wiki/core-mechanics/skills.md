## Skill Progression
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
A character's skill can range from 0 to 6 for a total of 7 levels, with each level using a different dice for checks. Skills improve by investing module points into modules.

<br> 

<div class="example-box">
A character that wants help care of their allies with medicine takes the medic module. They spend their module points investing into traits in that module. The first tier of that module is Field : Medicine, granting +1 skill with medicine.
</div> 

<br> 

| Skill Level | Die Type | Average Roll |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 0 - Untrained| d4       | 2.5          |
| 1 - Beginner| d6       | 3.5          |
| 2 - Novice| d8       | 4.5          |
| 3 - Journeyman| d10      | 5.5          |
| 4 - Proficient| d12      | 6.5          |
| 5 - Expert| d16      | 8.5          |
| 6 - Master| d20      | 10.5         |

<br> 

In most scenarios, skills are denoted by their dice type rather than a numerical value. For instance - if your character had journeyman fitness, the character sheet should show d10 instead of +3. 

## Skill Checks
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Skill checks are the core of how nearly everything is resolved in AnyventureDX. If you want your character to do anything "non-trivial", you must make a skill check to see if you succeed, fail, or end up somewhere inbetween. These checks are the primary 
way the plot advanced.

<br> 

When making a skill check:
1. The GM sets a Required Check (R.C.) for a check to succeed
2. Roll dice based on Talent and Skill (Talent determines how many dice are rolled, skill determines the dice type)
3. Take the highest dice rolled, and that is the value of your check.
4. GM resolves the check based on the success or failure.

### Typical RCs
| Difficulty | Required Check | Example |
|------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
|Trivial     |1         |Tying your own shoe           |
|Simple      |2-3       |Breaking down a wooden door           |
|Easy        |4-5       |Getting a discount from a merchant          |
|Moderate    |6-8       |Balancing on a tight rope           |
|Hard        |9-12      |Interpreting ancient text of a dead language           |
|Extreme     |13-16     |Beating a minotaur in arm wrestling           |
|Legendary   |17+       |Deceiving a dragon           |


## Helping Others
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Skill checks don't have to be done alone. When assisting someone else, a character has two options:

<br> 

- **Help with Same skill**: In order to assist with the same skill, a character must have the same or higher skill. This automatically grants the player you are helping a bonus dice on their skill check.
- **Help with a Different skill**: Pick another skill to assist with and roll a single dice if the GM decides the check is relevant. Otherwise, roll two dice for the skill and take the lowest value. If the result of the check meets the R.C., you grant the player you are helping a bonus dice.

<br>

<div class="example-box">
The party encounters a locked ancient door with a complex magical lock. The rogue (Thievery d12, 3 talents) attempts to pick it with an R.C. of 10.

**Scenario 1 - Same Skill Help**: The party's second rogue (Thievery d12, 2 talents) who is just as skilled, but not quite as talented as the main rogue wants to help pick a lock. Since they have an equal thievery skill, they automatically grant the main rogue a bonus die. The main rogue now rolls 4d12 instead of 3d12.

**Scenario 2 - Different Skill Help**: The wizard doesn't have thievery but offers to help by examining the magical components (Magic d16, 2 talents). The GM agrees this is relevant, so the wizard rolls a single d16. They roll a 12, beating the R.C. of 10, granting the rogue a bonus die. The rogue now rolls 4d12 for their attempt.

## Special Checks
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
There are different types of special checks that have specific rules or are referenced by other rules and modules:

<br> 

- **Attack Checks** - Attacking with a weapon, throwing something or making an unarmed attack.
- **Defense Check** - Making an evasion or deflection check
- **Crafting Check** - Attempting to create a new item based on a recipe
- **Magic Check** - Attempting to channel a spell
- **Death Check** - A completely random roll not affected by any abilities
<br> 


## Downgraded and Upgraded Skills
<div class="triangle-line"></div>

Some factors can cause a skill to be upgraded or downgraded, changing the dice progression. This results in the maximum potential being much higher for an upgraded skill, with the downgraded skill being lower.

### Complete Dice Progression Table

| Skill Level | Downgraded | Base Die | Upgraded |
|-------------|------------|----------|----------|
| 0           | d2         | d4       | d6       |
| 1           | d4         | d6       | d8       |
| 2           | d6         | d8       | d10      |
| 3           | d8         | d10      | d12      |
| 4           | d10        | d12      | d16      |
| 5           | d12        | d16      | d20      |
| 6           | d16        | d20      | d30      |

<br>

The most common cause for upgraded or downgraded skills are due to character size. A large creature will simply have a size advantage over a gnome if they were to arm wrestle. A large creature with 2 skill level will roll a d10 when making a might check, while a gnome with 2 skill level will roll a d6.
