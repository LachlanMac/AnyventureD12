## Skill Progression
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
A character's skill can range from 0 to 6 for a total of 7 levels, with each level using a different dice for checks. Skills improve by investing module points into modules.

<br> 

<div class="example-box">
A character that wants to function as a healer for their allies with medicine takes the medic module. They spend their module points investing into traits in that module. The first tier of that module is Field : Medicine, granting +1 skill with medicine.
</div>

| Skill Level | Die Type | Average Roll |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 0 - Untrained| d4       | 2.5          |
| 1 - Beginner| d6       | 3.5          |
| 2 - Novice| d8       | 4.5          |
| 3 - Journeyman| d10      | 5.5          |
| 4 - Proficient| d12      | 6.5          |
| 5 - Expert| d16      | 8.5          |
| 6 - Master| d20      | 10.5         |
| 7 - Grand Master| d24      | 12.5         |
<br> 

In most scenarios, skills are denoted by their dice type rather than a numerical value. For instance - if your character had journeyman fitness, the character sheet should show d10 instead of +3. 

## Skill Checks
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Skill checks are the core of how nearly everything is resolved in AnyventureDX. If you want your character to do anything "non-trivial", you must make a skill check to see if you succeed, fail, or end up somewhere in between. These checks are the primary 
way the plot advanced.

<br> 

When making a skill check:
1. The GM sets a Required Check (R.C.) for a check to succeed
2. Roll dice based on Talent and Skill (Talent determines how many dice are rolled, skill determines the dice type)
3. Take the highest dice rolled, and that is the value of your check.
4. GM resolves the check based on the success or failure.

### Typical RCs
| Difficulty | Required Check | Example |
|------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
|Trivial     |1         |Tying your own shoe           |
|Simple      |2-3       |Breaking down a wooden door           |
|Easy        |4-5       |Getting a discount from a merchant          |
|Moderate    |6-8       |Balancing on a tight rope           |
|Hard        |9-12      |Interpreting ancient text of a dead language           |
|Extreme     |13-16     |Beating a minotaur in arm wrestling           |
|Legendary   |17+       |Deceiving a dragon           |

### Skill Dice
In some cases, instead of a skill check, <b>skill dice</b> are called for to supplement another skill. A skill dice is whatever tier of dice you'd normally roll if you were making a standard skill check, but only rolling a single dice. 

<div class="example-box">
A gladiator has a reaction that is triggered after they roll any sort of contested or defense check. As an example, 
</div> 


## Contested Checks
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Instead of having a required check, some skills are contested when they are done in direct opposition to another character. This is called a contested check.

Some common examples of contested checks:
- Persuasion against Insight when attempting to lie to someone
- Presence against Resilience when attempting to intimidate someone
- Coordination against Coordination when attempting to both grab the same item
- Endurance against Might when attempting to tire out an opponent in arm wrestling.

<br>

Contested checks are resolved easily; the higher value succeeds and the lower value fails. Ties can be resolved as they occur, but the general strategy should be there is "no change" if the checks are equal.

<div class="example-box">
  <strong>Example 1 - Bluffing the Guard</strong><br>
  <em>Situation:</em> Nyla tries to talk her way past a fortress guard by claiming she is an official courier.<br>
  <em>Check:</em> Nyla rolls <strong>Persuasion 11</strong> vs. the Guard’s <strong>Insight 9</strong>.<br>
  <em>Outcome:</em> Nyla’s higher result convinces the guard, who lets her through.
</div>

<div class="example-box">
  <strong>Example 2 - The Falling Gem</strong><br>
  <em>Situation:</em> Two adventurers, Kellan and Mira, dive to snatch a gem that slips from a pedestal.<br>
  <em>Check:</em> Both roll <strong>Coordination</strong>. Kellan scores <strong>7</strong>; Mira scores <strong>7</strong>.<br>
  <em>Outcome:</em> It’s a tie, so per the rule there is “no change.” The gem clatters to the floor, unclaimed for now.
</div>

## Helping Others
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Skill checks don't have to be done alone. When assisting someone else, a character has two options:

<br> 

- **Help with Same skill**: In order to assist with the same skill, a character must have the same or higher skill. This automatically grants the player you are helping a bonus dice on their skill check.
- **Help with a Different skill**: Pick another skill to assist with and roll a single dice if the GM decides the check is relevant. Otherwise, roll two dice for the skill and take the lowest value. If the result of the check meets the R.C., you grant the player you are helping a bonus dice.

<br>

<div class="example-box">
  <strong>Example 1 - Same-Skill Help</strong><br>
  <em>Situation:</em> The rogue (Thievery d12, 3 talents) tackles an ancient door’s intricate lock (R.C. 10).<br>
  <em>Assist:</em> A second rogue (Thievery d12, 2 talents) joins in. Because their Thievery skill dice match, they automatically grant a bonus die.<br>
  <em>Result:</em> The primary rogue rolls <strong>4d12</strong> instead of 3d12.
</div>

<div class="example-box">
  <strong>Example 2 - Different-Skill Help</strong><br>
  <em>Situation:</em> The same lock contains arcane wards. The wizard (Magic d16, 2 talents) offers insight.<br>
  <em>Assist:</em> Lacking Thievery, the wizard rolls a single d16. A roll of <strong>12</strong> beats the R.C. 10, so the rogue gains a bonus die.<br>
  <em>Result:</em> The rogue again rolls <strong>4d12</strong> on the lock-picking attempt.
</div>

## Special Checks
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
There are different types of special checks that have specific rules or are referenced by other rules and modules:

<br> 

- **Attack Checks** - Attacking with a weapon, throwing something or making a brawling attack.
- **Defense Check** - Making an evasion or deflection check
- **Crafting Check** - Attempting to create a new item based on a recipe
- **Magic Check** - Attempting to channel a spell
- **Death Check** - A completely random roll not affected by any abilities
<br> 


## Downgraded and Upgraded Skills
<div class="triangle-line"></div>

Some factors can cause a skill to be upgraded or downgraded, changing the dice progression. This results in the maximum potential being much higher for an upgraded skill, with the downgraded skill being lower.

### Complete Dice Progression Table

| Skill Level | Downgraded | Base Die | Upgraded |
|-------------|------------|----------|----------|
| 0           | d2         | d4       | d6       |
| 1           | d4         | d6       | d8       |
| 2           | d6         | d8       | d10      |
| 3           | d8         | d10      | d12      |
| 4           | d10        | d12      | d16      |
| 5           | d12        | d16      | d20      |
| 6           | d16        | d20      | d24      |
| 7           | d20        | d24      | d30      |

<br>

The most common cause for upgraded or downgraded skills are due to character size. A large creature will simply have a size advantage over a gnome if they were to arm wrestle. A large creature with 2 skill level will roll a d10 when making a might check, while a gnome with 2 skill level will roll a d6.
