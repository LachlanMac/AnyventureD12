# Attributes & Talents

## Talents ##
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Talents are one half of the dice rolling system. All skills in AnyventureDX have a talent associated with them.:

- **Attribute**: Talents in your 5 attributes [see below]
- **Weapon**: Talents in [simple/complex melee weapons, simple/complex ranged weapons, throwing and unarmed combat]
- **Magic**: Talents in [black magic, meta magic, divine magic, mysticism magic, primal magic ] 
- **Crafting**: Talents in [fabrication, alchemy, engineering, glyphcraft, bioshaping, cooking ] 
- **Music**: Talents in [vocal, percussion, wind, strings, brass]

<br> 

**Talents determine how many dice you roll.** If a character has 0 talents in a skill, that means they cannot make a roll.

<br> 

<div class="example-box">
A character has 2 talents in black magic, and 0 talents in divine magic. This character can never channel a spell from divine magic because they do not have the innate ability to do so. However, when making a black magic check, the roll 2 dice.
</div>


## The Five Attributes
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Every character has five core attributes that define their natural capabilities. Attributes work differently than other talents because each attribute has four skills associated with it:

### Physique
(Fitness, Deflection, Might, Endurance)
### Finesse 
(Evasion, Stealth, Coordination, Thievery)
### Mind
(Resilience, Concentration, Senses, Logic)
### Knowledge
(Wildcraft, Academics, Magic, Medicine)
### Social
(Expression, Presence, Insight, Persuasion)

<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Unlike skills, attributes are a category rather than an actual game mechanic. You will never roll a physique or social check to resolve something. Attributes exist only to define your talents and how they affect the skills within the same cateogry.
Attributes do not directly affect the tier of your dice, but only affect *how many* dice you roll for all skills under that umbrella.
<div class="example-box">
A character with 3 talents in Finesse will roll 3 dice for any evasion, stealth, coordination or thievery check. The type of dice rolled is determined by the **skill**.
</div>

## Character Creation
Assigning talents to attributes only happens during character creation as they are a representation of innate ability. Pick carefully!

During character creation:
1. All attributes start at **1**
2. You have **6 points** to distribute
3. The maximum talents you can assign to an attribute is **4**
4. An attribute of a player character can never be lower than **1**
