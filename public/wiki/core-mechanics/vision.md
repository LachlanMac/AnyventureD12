# Vision & Senses

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

All creatures in AnyventureDX have at least one way to sense the environment around them. In some scenarios, items and skills will allow a character to use one of their senses up to a certain range. If it isn't specified, the sense is assumed to be unlimited within a sensible distance. When there is room for interpretation, a character should make a senses check.

### Standard Vision
Most creatures with eyes have standard vision, allowing them to see normally. When a character who has standard vision cannot see, they are considered blinded.

### Darksight
Darksight is magical in nature and allows a creature to see normally even in pitch-black conditions.

### Infravision
Infravision allows a creature to see into the infrared spectrum. This allows them to determine differences in temperatures between creatures and objects.

### Deadsight
Deadsight is a special type of magical sight that allows a creature to see normally in pitch-black conditions but also see creatures that are affected by magical invisibility effects.

### Echolocation
A special sense that allows a creature to gain information about their surroundings by using sound to to determine distances. A deafened creature would be considered blinded if they relied completely on this sense.

### Tremorsense
A sense that is so precise it allows a creature to detect small micromovements in the ground and even air to determine the distances and approximate locations of creatures.

### Truesight
A magical sight that allows the creature to see in complete darkness as well as visibly see strands of magics, allowing them to see enchantments, magical disguises and invisibility effects.

## Line of Sight

Having line of sight on a creature is crucial to several abilities - especially ones that target a specific creature with a ranged weapon or magical spell.

## Darkness

There are several types of light levels that affect different abilities:

### Complete Darkness

Complete darkness is the absence of light due to either a magical effect or being in a space where light cannot reach such as a dungeon, cave, or room without windows. Any creature who relies on <b>standard vision</b> for sight is considered to have the blinded condition while in complete darkness. 

### Partial Darkness

Partial darkness is when there is enough light to see well enough to target other creatures. 

### Light 

Light can be caused by sunlight, indoor lighting, light sources or other forms of ambient illuminations.


## Light Sources

There are various light sources that can create gaps in darkness.
