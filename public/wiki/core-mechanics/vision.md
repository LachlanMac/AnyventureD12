# Vision & Senses

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

All creatures in AnyventureDX have at least one way to sense the environment around them. In some scenarios, items and skills will allow a character to use one of their senses up to a certain range. If it isn't specified, the sense is assumed to be unlimited within a sensible distance. When there is room for interpretation, a character should make a senses check.

### Standard Vision
Most creatures with eyes have standard vision, allowing them to see normally. When a character who has standard vision cannot see, they are considered blinded.

### Darksight
Darksight is magical in nature and allows a creature to see normally even in pitch-black conditions.

### Infravision
Infravision allows a creature to see into the infrared spectrum. This allows them to determine differences in temperatures between creatures and objects.

### Deadsight
Deadsight is a special type of magical vision that not only allows creatures to see normally in conditions without light. This sense is also unique because it allows the creature to see invisible and obscured creatures.

### Echolocation
A special sense that allows a creature to gain information about their surroundings by using sound to to determine distances. A deafened creature would be considered blinded if they relied completely on this sense.

### Tremorsense
A sense that is so precise it allows a creature to detect small micromovements in the ground and even air to determine the distances and approximate locations of creatures.

### Truesight
A magical sight that allows the creature to see in complete darkness as well as see through magical effects like illusions, invisibility and spells that mask a creature's true form.
