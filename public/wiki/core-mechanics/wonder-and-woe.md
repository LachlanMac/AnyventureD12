# Wonder & Woe

Wonder and woe are a sort of meta currency that can be obtained through various means. The awarding of these currencies is done by the GM when an event of note occurs. Depending on the event, these can be given to the entire party or just an individual character.

A character can only have 1 wonder and 1 woe at a single time and either can be cashed in at any moment, even when it is not the character's turn.
