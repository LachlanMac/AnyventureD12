# Environments

The world of Anyventure contains diverse environments that affect gameplay, from dense forests to scorching deserts. Understanding environments is important for abilities that reference specific terrain types.

## Natural Environments

A **natural environment** is any location that exists primarily due to natural processes rather than humanoid construction. Many abilities, especially those from nature-focused modules like Naturalist, Druid, or Hunter, require or benefit from being in a natural environment.

### Examples of Natural Environments

| Environment Type | Examples |
|------------------|----------|
| **Forest** | Woodlands, jungles, groves, thickets |
| **Plains** | Grasslands, savannas, meadows, steppes |
| **Mountains** | Peaks, cliffs, rocky highlands, alpine regions |
| **Desert** | Sandy dunes, rocky badlands, salt flats |
| **Swamp** | Marshes, bogs, wetlands, mangroves |
| **Tundra** | Frozen plains, permafrost, arctic wastes |
| **Coast** | Beaches, tide pools, sea caves, coral reefs |
| **Underground** | Natural caves, caverns, underground rivers |
| **Aquatic** | Rivers, lakes, oceans, underwater environments |

### What is NOT a Natural Environment

The following locations are generally **not** considered natural environments:

- Cities, towns, and villages
- Buildings and dungeons (unless overgrown/reclaimed by nature)
- Constructed roads and paved surfaces
- Mines and excavated tunnels
- Magical or planar environments (GM discretion)

> **GM Note:** Environments can be mixed or transitional. A ruined castle overtaken by vines and wildlife might count as a natural environment at the GM's discretion. When in doubt, consider whether natural elements or constructed elements dominate the area.

## Hazards

Hazards are environmental dangers that can harm or hinder characters. They are not creatures and cannot be attacked in the traditional sense, but they can often be avoided, mitigated, or overcome with the right skills.

### Environmental Hazards

| Hazard | Effect | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Extreme Heat** | Characters must make an Endurance check each hour or gain the Winded condition. Prolonged exposure may cause Heat damage. | Cold mitigation, appropriate clothing, shade |
| **Extreme Cold** | Characters must make an Endurance check each hour or gain the Winded condition. Prolonged exposure may cause Cold damage. | Heat mitigation, appropriate clothing, shelter |
| **Difficult Terrain** | Movement through the area costs double. | Some abilities ignore difficult terrain |
| **Obscured Vision** | Fog, smoke, or darkness that imposes penalty dice on sight-based checks. | Appropriate vision types (Darksight, etc.) |
| **Thin Air** | At high altitudes, physical exertion requires Endurance checks or causes Winded. | Acclimatization, slow travel |
| **Toxic Air** | Poisonous gases or spores. Characters must hold breath or make Endurance checks against Poisoned condition. | Toxic mitigation, air filtration |

### Terrain Hazards

| Hazard | Effect | Avoidance |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Quicksand** | Characters who enter must make a Fitness check or become Impaired. Failed attempts to escape cause sinking. | Coordination check to spot, Might check to pull free |
| **Unstable Ground** | May collapse. Characters must make Coordination checks or fall. | Senses check to detect, careful movement |
