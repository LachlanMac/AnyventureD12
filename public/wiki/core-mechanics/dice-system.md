# Dice System

## How Dice Work in AnyventureDX
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Anyventure uses a unique dice system where:  

<br>

- **Talent** (from attributes and character creation) determines **how many dice** you roll
- **Skill** level determines **what type of dice** you roll
- **Pool** is the term for the total dice you rolled for a skill check

<br>

These rules are true for any type of skill check.

## Bonus and Penalty Dice
<div class="triangle-line"></div>

Bonus and Penalty dice are a way to represent advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios, either giving you a more likely chance of reaching your potential, or in the case of penalty dice, a greater chance at failure.

### Bonus Dice
Add extra dice to your pool:
- **2 Talent, 3 Skill, +1 Bonus Dice**: Roll 3d10, take highest
- **1 Talent, 4 Skill, +2 Bonus DIce**: Roll 3d12, take highest

### Penalty Dice
When you roll with penalty, you reduce your dice pool. When you cannot reduce your dice pool further, you start rolling more dice, but taking the lowest result.
- **3 Talent, 2 Skill, -1 Penalty**: Roll 2d8, take highest
- **2 Talent, 3 Skill, -2 Penalty**: Roll 2d10, take lowest
- **1 Talent, 4 Skill, -3 Penalty**: Roll 3d12, take lowest
<br>

<div class="note-box">
Penalty and Bonus dice cancel each other out. If you have 2 Bonus Dice and 1 Penalty Dice applied to a roll, this is the same as applying just 1 Bonus Dice.
