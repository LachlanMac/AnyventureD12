# Languages

Languages in Anyventure represent your character's ability to communicate and understand different cultures, magical traditions, and peoples. Language proficiency is measured in three distinct levels, each affecting your social interactions and capabilities.

## Language Proficiency Levels

### Basic (1 Star)
- **Mechanical Effect**: -1 penalty die on Persuasion and Insight checks when communicating in this language
- **Description**: You can handle simple conversations, basic trade, and essential communication. Complex topics, nuanced discussions, and cultural subtleties are beyond your grasp. You might misunderstand idioms or struggle with formal speech.

### Fluency (2 Stars)
- **Mechanical Effect**: No penalty or bonus to social checks
- **Description**: You can communicate naturally and comfortably in most situations. You understand cultural context, can engage in complex discussions, and rarely struggle with vocabulary or grammar. This is the standard level for native speakers and well-educated individuals.

### Mastery (3 Stars)
- **Mechanical Effect**: +1 bonus die on Persuasion and Insight checks when communicating in this language
- **Description**: You possess exceptional command of the language, including archaic forms, regional dialects, and formal registers. You can recognize subtle linguistic clues about someone's origin, education, or social status. Your eloquence and perfect pronunciation mark you as highly educated or culturally immersed.

## Language Types

Languages fall into several categories:

### Common Language
Common is the language diplomacy and commerce and is spoken to some degree in most civilized places. All adventurers start off with at least <b>fluency</b> in common, besides primitive humanoids.

### Non-Magical Languages
Standard languages spoken by major cultures and nations. 

### Magical Languages
Ancient or mystical languages tied to magical traditions. Some spells may require specific magical languages, and these languages often carry additional benefits when used in magical contexts.



## Learning Languages

Languages can be learned through:
- **Cultural background** (determined during character creation)
- **Module progression** (some modules grant language proficiency)
- **Training and study** (downtime activities)
- **Immersion** (spending extended time in areas where the language is spoken)

The time required to advance language proficiency depends on your current level, available resources, and opportunities for practice.
