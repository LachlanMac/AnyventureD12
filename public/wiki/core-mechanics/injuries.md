# Injuries

Injuries represent lasting physical and mental trauma that characters can sustain during their adventures. These wounds go beyond simple hit point damage and can have lasting mechanical and narrative effects.

## Cosmetic Injuries

Cosmetic injuries are minor wounds that have primarily narrative impact with minimal mechanical effects. They serve as visible reminders of past battles and adventures without significantly impacting a character's abilities.
