## Measuring Distances

In AnyventureDX, all distances are measured in units. A unit can be visualized as roughly a yard, meter or 3 feet.

When ranges are listed, for instance how far a ranged weapon can shoot or large of an area a spell affects, they fall within one of the description categories. These categores are below:


| Distance | Units|
|------|--------|
| Adjacent  | 0 | bordering a tile, within range to touch |
| Nearby    | 1 | 
| Very Short| 2-5 |
| Short     | 6-10 | 
| Moderate  | 11-20 |
| Far       | 21-40 | 
| Very Far  | 41-60 |
| Distant    | 61-100 |
| Planar    | Unlimited |

### Optimal Ranges

Ranged and throwing weapons have optimal distances they are effective at. All ranged weapons include a minimum and maximum range. A character can attempt to operate a ranged weapon at a target one level of distance outside of their optimal range, they roll their attack with 2 penalty dice.   

<br>

A character is only allowed to make a ranged attack up to one distance greater than their optimal range, but there is no limit on the minimum they can make.

<div class="example-box">
  A character has 3 talent and 4 skill with simple ranged weapons, so they normally roll a 3d12 for their attacks. A crossbow is most effective at <b>short</b> to <b>moderate</b> range which would give it an effective range of 6-20 units. If the character wielding the crossbow wants to shoot a target a creature within a <b>very short</b> distance (2-5 units away) or even an <b>adjacent</b> creature, they would roll with 2 penalty dice, bringing their attack roll to a 1d12. Likewise, a target at a <b>distant range</b> (20-40 units) would also give them the same penalty. However, because <b>remote</b> is two levels higher than their maximum range, they cannot attempt an attack.

## Measuring Weight

Instead of using a unit like pound (lb), kilograms (kg) or ounces (oz), weight in AnyventureDX is measured in a pseudo-unit called *bulk* or *bulk units*. In real world measurements, a bulk is in between a kilogram and a pound. A dagger, hard-cover book and pair of boots would all be about 1*bu*.


Weights in AnyventureDX are mostly to interact with abilities or determine what size objects can be thrown or manipulated by spells and other effects. However, for determining how much a character can carry, by default, *Common Sense Carry Weight* is the recommended method of tracking inventory. Players and the GM should work together to ensure that their characters are not carrying too many items that would be unreasonable.


### Optional Carry Weight
In the case where a GM and the players want to be more methodical about tracking carry weight, the weight of all items is added on the inventory and compared against a character's *maximum carry weight*. This number is determined by a character's size:

| Size   | Maximum Carry Weight              |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| Small  | 25 Bulk (~35–50 lbs / 16–23 kg)   |
| Medium | 50 Bulk (~70–100 lbs / 32–45 kg)  |
| Large  | 75 Bulk (~105–150 lbs / 48–68 kg) |

This carry weight does *NOT* include the character's equipment in the calculation.
