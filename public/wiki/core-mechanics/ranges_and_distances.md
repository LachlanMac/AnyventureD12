# Range and Distance

## Measuring Distances

In AnyventureDX, all distances are measured in units. A unit can be visualized as roughly a yard, meter or 3 feet.

When ranges are listed, for instance how far a ranged weapon can shoot or large of an area a spell affects, they fall within one of the description categories. These categores are below:


| Distance | Units|
|------|--------|
| Adjacent  | 0 | bordering a tile, within range to touch |
| Nearby    | 1 | 
| Very Short| 2-5 |
| Short     | 6-10 | 
| Moderate  | 11-20 |
| Distant   | 21-40 |  
| Remote    | 40-100 |
| Planar    | Unlimited |

## Optimal Ranges

Ranged and throwing weapons have optimal distances they are effective at. All ranged weapons include a minimum and maximum range. A character can attempt to operate a ranged weapon at a target one level of distance outside of their optimal range, they roll their attack with 2 penalty dice.

A character is only allowed to make a ranged attack up to one distance greater than their optimal range, but there is no limit on the minimum they can make.

<div class="example-box">
  A character has 3 talent and 4 skill with simple ranged weapons, so they normally roll a 3d12 for their attacks. A crossbow is most effective at <b>short</b> to <b>moderate</b> range which would give it an effective range of 6-20 units. If the character wielding the crossbow wants to shoot a target a creature within a <b>very short</b> distance (2-5 units away) or even an <b>adjacent</b> creature, they would roll with 2 penalty dice, bringing their attack roll to a 1d12. Likewise, a target at a <b>distant range</b> (20-40 units) would also give them the same penalty. However, because <b>remote</b> is two levels higher than their maximum range, they cannot attempt an attack.
