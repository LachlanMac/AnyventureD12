<div class="triangle-line"></div>

A pet is a tamed creature that is loyal to a certain character. In most cases, the creature will do their best to stay in the proximity of their owner. Unless a pet is commanded, it will act on it's own volition. 
In combat, a pet will only act if it is commanded to do so. Issuing a command to a pet requires an action.

## Pet Limits

By default, a character can only have one pet at a time in their adventuring party. They can utilize stables or other long-term care services to have more than one pet, but only one can be active at a time. A pet can be designated as a <b>mount</b> to bypass this limit.

## Taming

Taming is the process of gaining a creature's trust and the first step in obtaining a pet. To tame a creature, you must make three successful wildcraft checks against your target's taming check within 1 day. Not all creatures are tameable; some are simply too wild.
By default, only beasts are eligible to be tamed.

When you successfully tame a creature, it is immediately considered your pet. However, that doesn't mean it will be instantly obedient or even do as you say. By all accounts, it is still a wild creature that has just figured out it can rely on you for safety and/or food.  

<div class="example-box">A scenario involves a hunter encountering a lone wolf while on a hunt. Wolves are fairly wild and difficult to tame, requiring a taming check of 8. The hunter must make a wildcraft check of 8 to tame it.</div>

## Command Training

Creatures that are tameable have a maximum tier of commands they can learn based on how trainable they are and their intelligence. This is represented by one of the following: <b>Basic</b>, <b>Intermediate</b> and <b>Advanced</b>. Teaching a creature any of these commands requires making a successful taming check three days in a row. Each check requires an hour of time. Intermediate checks are rolled with a penalty dice and advanced checks are rolled with two penalty dice.

### Basic

Commands that rely on simple instincts and require minimal intelligence. These commands are clear, direct, and don't require the creature to make decisions. By default, issuing a command to a creature takes an action, at which point the pet will attempt to take the action at the earliest possibility.

- **Come** - The creature moves to you immediately
- **Stay** - The creature remains in place until released
- **Fetch** - The creature retrieves a visible object and returns it to you
- **Guard** - The creature watches over a location and alerts you to intruders (but doesn't decide how to respond)
- **Ride** - The creature will allow the owner or a passenger to ride it. 
### Intermediate

Commands that require the creature to understand context and make simple decisions based on the situation.

- **Attack** - The creature takes its full turn in combat (can move, use abilities, and attack a designated target)
- **Scout** - The creature explores ahead and returns to report on threats or points of interest
- **Track** - The creature follows a scent or trail to locate a target
- **Defend** - The creature actively protects a designated creature or location, deciding when to engage threats

### Advanced

Commands that require high intelligence, judgment, and the ability to act independently to fulfill complex objectives.

- **Hunt** - The creature searches for, kills, and retrieves food without supervision
- **Patrol** - The creature independently guards an area, making decisions about threats and when to alert you
- **Search** - The creature systematically searches an area for specific items, scents, or hidden dangers
- **Rescue** - The creature identifies and assists incapacitated allies (dragging them to safety, fetching help, etc.)

<div class="note-box">Some GM's may want to play out training in a more interactive way. For instance, attempting to ride a beast that normally does not want to be ridden could result in a scenario where a failure could result in the rider being thrown off.</div>

## Purchasing

In many instances, pets can be purchased with different levels of training. The most common type of pet would be a riding horse, which should be readily available. When a pet is purchased, ownership is transferred immediately.

### Common Pets & Prices

| Pet | Base Price |
|-----|------------|
| Riding Horse | 50g |
| War Horse | 200g |
| Hunting Dog | 50g |
| Falcon | 40g |
| Mule/Donkey | 30g |
| Raven | 20g |

<div class="note-box">Prices may vary by region, availability, and quality of training.</div>


# Mounts

Mounts are pets that have been trained to be ridden and have more limited rules associated with them. By default, the only command that can be issued to a mount is the "Ride" command which does not require an action while mounted. This allows the mounted character to use the movement speed of the mount instead of their own.

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

## Riding

While mounted on your turn, you can choose to use your mount's speed or your own. You can never use both on the same turn. When it is not your turn, any movement that you gain from effects, spells or reactions dismounts you immediately upon moving.

### Sprinting

When you elect to use your mount's speed on your turn, you can have it sprint instead, but it must make an encumbrance check against double your encumbrance penalty. A failure causes your mount to become winded. Your mount automatically takes the Rest action on it's next turn if it does not move or act, ending it's turn prematurely. 

<div class="example-box">A knight with armor, a lance and shield is attempting to cover a great deal of ground while riding their warhorse. They choose to upgrade their mounts movement to a sprint, forcing their warhorse to make a fitness check 
against their encumbrance penalty which currently sits at a whopping 8. Their mount has a fitness score that allows them to roll a 3d10, making it very possible that the warhorse will get the winded condition upon a failure.</div>

### Jumping

Some mounts have the capacity to jump as part of their movement, but this is an exception to the rule. These rules will vary from creature to creature and be present within the statblock.

### Combat

In combat, either you or your mount can be targeted. Some mounts give bonuses to their rider, but it should be assumed by default that each creature (the rider and mount) use their own defense checks to avoid and mitigate attacks. When included in an area effect, both creatures must make a check, following normal rules for avoiding the attack.

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

## Size Rules

A mount must be at least one size larger than the character who is riding it. Riding a huge or larger creature creates unique situations where a rider or passenger who is usually targetable cannot be reached with adjacent attacks, and can likewise not make attacks against adjacent targets. Situations like this are best handled on a case-by-case basis, as the build and mounted position on a creature could affect how much sense this makes in a tactical situation.

## Mounting & Dismounting

### Mounting

Mounting is as simple as taking the Use action while adjacent to your mount. However, you cannot use your mount's movement on the same turn that you mount it.

### Dismounting

Willfully dismounting is as simple as using your movement instead of your mount's to move to an adjacent or more distant tile.

There are several ways to be forcibly dismounted, with the most common being any move that shoves or displaces you. When you are displaced while on a mount, you are knocked off of it, take 1d4 fall damage and land prone in an adjacent tile to your mount. Additionally, if your mount is knocked prone, you are dismounted. 

Certain saddles can provide bonuses against being dismounted or displaced while mounted.
