# Songs & Music

## Musical Talents

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

Musical talents allow a character to perform music by making an expression check. Characters within a short (10 unit) distance are assumed to hear the song and are subjected to the benefits or penalties it applies.

By default, characters do not have any talents in any musical category. There are 5 types of musical skill are Vocal, Percussion, Wind, Strings and Brass. Because musical talents rely on expression checks, the talents in the individual musical skills instead enhance that check.

### No Talent
The character has no idea how to use the magical talent, but can force their way through if their expression skill is high enough. Without talent, any expression check while using the talent is rolled with a penalty dice.

### Novice (1 Talent)
The character has enough experience to not mess it up and carry a pleasant tune to most ears. They do not roll with a bonus or penalty when making an expression check using their musical talent. To become a beginner in a talent, a character is expected to dedicate over 100 hours to learning their craft.

### Expert (2 Talents)
Experts have dedicated enough time to their magical talent where they are consistently good. They gain a bonus dice when making expression checks using their musical talent. To become a novice in a musical talent, a character is expected to dedicate over 1000 hours to learning their craft. Most campaigns would not be expected to have this much downtime in a campaign, so becoming an expert will usually only be available at character creation or by advanced module selection.

### Master (3 Talents)
Masters have perfected their craft and gain 2 bonus dice when making expression checks using their musical talent. This type of talent is accumulated over several years and often decades and only attainable through special circumstances.


## Performing Songs

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

Songs can provide short or long term benefits to multiple people which makes them especially valuable. By default, a character does not 'know' any songs unless they are granted from either a culture, starting trait or module.

Some songs are more difficult than others to both learn and perform. To start a song, a character must make an expression check equal to or higher than what the song requires. It also requires concentration to play or participate in a song.

Performing songs with just vocals is definitely the most efficient way to perform a song if in combat. Singing does not require an action, nor does it require having both hands free. To perform a song with an instrument, the character must use an action and have both hands available. If the character takes any reaction or action that uses either of their hands, their performance with that instrument ends, immediately removing any benefits their part provided.

When performing a song in combat, the performer must make the check every single turn to keep it going. If the lead performer does not continue the song on their turn, or the song is interrupted by some other means, such as losing concentration, the song no longer provides any benefit. If no one else is participating in the song, the song ends. Otherwise, the lead performer can attempt to rejoin the song on their next action with a success leading to benefits being restored.

<div class="note-box">
A character can only benefit from receiving a unique song once per day. This limit is reset on completion of a full rest.

<div class="example-box">
    It is the battle-skald's turn and they want to perform the song of battle which grants all allies who hear it a free weapon attack that does not count against their turn limit. The skald has 2 talents and 4 skill in the expression skill, so by default they would roll a 2d12 with a required check of 6 on the song they want to play. They are also an expert vocalist and want to sing the song so they can dedicate their hands to swinging their swords. This means they roll with a bonus dice for a 3d12, and as expected, they succeed as their highest dice rolled was a 10, and all allies within 10 units gain the effects of the song on their turn. Because they are only using their voice, they only need to dedicate their concentration. If the skald has not lost their concentration before their next turn, they must make the check again, or the song ends. If the skald does lose concentration, the benefits end immediately.

## Joining In

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

All songs have a melody and a harmony which allows multiple people to join in and contribute. Typically, songs have one or more harmony bonuses that enhance the effects of the song. The person who started the song always is considered to be playing the melody.

To join in, a character must know the song that is being played. If they do, they can simply elect to join the song during their turn and make an expression check, applying any bonuses from musical talents. To successfully contribute to the harmony, they must use their concentration. The same rule applies to needing both hands free to play as well as dedicating an action. For this reason, most people who wish to contribute to a song will use their vocal skill.

### Harmony

Songs have one or more harmonies that allow additional benefits. These harmonies are always listed as instrumental talents instead of vocalizations. A character can 'improvise' and play a different instrument to satisfy the harmony, but the required check is increased by +2. 

<div class="note-box">
   As long as one person is playing the harmony, all characters who are benefiting from the song benefit from that harmony bonus. A character must be within the radius of the melody to benefit from the song, but they do not need to be within range of a harmony.  
</div>

<div class="example-box">
    Take the previous example with the skald playing the song of battle; the archer in the party fancies themselves a lutist (Novice Talent), and wants to contribute to the song with their expression check of 3d8. The song of battle has a harmony part for a lute that causes the song to grant a +1 bonus dice to all weapon attacks. Because this requires the archer's hands, they decide to shoot their bow with their first action, and then play the song for their second action, dedicating their concentration. They barely succeed with an expression check of 6. While they wouldn't benefit from the +1 bonus dice, all their allies would. However, the situation becomes complicated later in the round by an enemy approaching the archer and striking them with a claw. The archer decides to attempt to parry the attack with a special reaction they have. Using a weapon requires a hand, so their harmony ends and all the benefits it provides.
</div>

<div class="example-box">
    As an extension of our archer lutist, lets assume because he is being chased down, he wants a different effect. The song of battle also has a percussion part that grants +2 to movement speed. However, they don't have a drum - they have a lute. The check to harmonize with their lute becomes an 8 instead of a 6. This means they must get at least one maximum roll on their 3d8. Unfortunately, they fail and their action is wasted.

## Learning Songs

There are a few methods of learning songs;

Songs can be taught, learned from sheet music, or composed. A character can attempt to learn a song once per day, with the check starting out at double the required expression check to play the song and being reduced by 1 each attempt. This number cannot be reduced below the original required check of the song. 

Composing a song is the same as picking a song that exists in the items database and learning it without any resource to aid in the process. Composing a song is similar to learning a song, except the required double expression check is never reduced.
