# Weapons & Damage

## Weapon Categories

### Weapon Skills
Every character starts with different talent levels:
- **Unarmed**: +1 Talent (everyone can punch)
- **Throwing**: +1 Talent (everyone can throw)
- **Simple Melee**: +1 Talent
- **Simple Ranged**: +1 Talent
- **Complex Melee**: +0 Talent (requires training)
- **Complex Ranged**: +0 Talent (requires training)

## How Damage Works

Unlike traditional RPGs, Anyventure doesn't use separate damage rolls:

1. **Roll your attack** (Talent + Skill dice)
2. **Count successful hits** (dice that beat defense)
3. **Apply weapon damage**:
   - First hit = Base damage
   - Each extra hit = Extra damage

### Example: Longsword
- **Base Damage**: 3 Physical
- **Extra Damage**: 2 Physical per extra hit

If you hit with 3 dice: 3 + 2 + 2 = **7 total damage**

## Damage Types

Weapons deal different damage types:
- **Physical**: Most weapons
- **Heat**: Fire-enchanted weapons
- **Cold**: Ice-enchanted weapons
- **Lightning**: Storm-touched weapons
- **Toxic**: Poisoned weapons

Different creatures have different mitigations to these types.

## Range Penalties

Attacking outside optimal range:
- **Within range**: Normal roll
- **Beyond range**: -1 or -2 dice penalty
- **Too close**: May suffer penalties for ranged weapons

## Two-Weapon Fighting

With the right modules:
- Attack with both weapons as one action
- Each weapon rolls separately
- Requires specific training/modules
