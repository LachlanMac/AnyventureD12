# Non-Player Characters

## Creature Tiers
Instead of levels, enemies in AnyventureDX are broken down into tiers, from the lowest of minions to mythic entities beyond the comprehension of most mortals.

### Non-Combatant
The lowest of tiers, non-combatants are not expected to offer any meaningful contribution to a fight. Small animals like rabbits, cats or snakes would fit in this category and typically more often be employed for their skills rather than combat prowess.

### Minion
Minions are the lowest form of creature that can participate in combat and are usually dispatched easily. Minions can range from a creature like a wolf, dryad or a runty kobold.

### Grunt
Grunts can be dangerous in number, but an average adventurer should be able to defeat at least a couple grunts in a fight. Bandits, squires, skeletons and harpies would fall into this category. 

### Standard
Standard creatures typically have the equivalent skills of a starting adventurer with few module points or skills. In favorable conditions, they should be considered an even fight to an average adventurer. Lions, knights and velociraptors would be common standard tier opponents.  

### Champion
Champions represent the top level of what a humanoid can acheive. Champion tiered creatures include archmages, renowned gladiators and treants.

### Elite
Elites are creatures that would take a team of adventurers to defeat. This cateogry includes wyverns, liches, and devils. Elite creatures will be the main adversaries for a group of adventures so the range of power between the weakest and strongest elite can be quite large. Because of this, they have a star system from 1 star (the weakest) to 5 stars (the strongest) that is displayed next to their tier when viewing their statblocks.

### Legend
Legends are creatures that are so epic, defeating them would make the victors the subject of history books. They typically would take an incredibly resourceful and powerful group of adventurers to defeat. The likes of ancient dragons and krakens would fit into this group.

### Mythic
Mythic creatures include entities and are not meant to be defeated by normal means. These creatures are often only destroyed by rituals or special artifacts, otherwise confronting one unprepared would bring certain doom. These include demi-gods, avatars and primal forces.


## Types

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

Creatures come in all shapes and sizes. Certain skills, mechanics and spells only work against a specific type of creature.

### Humanoid
Humanoids make up all of the playable ancestries and many more. A humanoid is defined as a creature that is human-like; bipedal, speaks a language and has a culture.
### Beast
Beasts are the most common type of creature; unintelligent animals that have survival as their main goal. These include anything from tigers and mammoths to more exotic and mythical creatures like the griffon.
### Monster
Monsters are similar to beasts, but usually have a different origin than regular animals. Monsters is a very broad category including creatures like hydras, dragons, giants and mutated insects.
### Plantoid
Plantoids are simply plants that have some form of sentience. This can be treants, dryads or the horrible venus mantrap. 
### Elemental
Elementals are primal creatures that often take the form of elements such as water, ice, fire, electric, wind or earth.
### Dark
Dark creatures are typically associated with evil and can include demons, devils and spawn from the void.
### Divine
Divine creatures are celestials from the heavens. This can include valkyrs, angels, pegasi or the mythical phoenix.
### Undead
Undead creatures are typically other types of creatures that have been risen from death, usually by magic or curses. This includes liches, zombies, ghouls and skeletons.
### Construct
Constructs are creatures that have been built or animated by someone else. They typically act as servants and can range from clockwork minions to golems.
### Fey
Fey creatures are the faeries that come from the feywild. These curious and sometimes malicious creatures count sprites, satyrs, and pumpklings among their ranks.
