# Weapons & Damage

## Weapon Categories

### Weapon Skills
Every character starts with different talent levels:
- **Unarmed**: +1 Talent (everyone can punch)
- **Throwing**: +1 Talent (everyone can throw)
- **Simple Melee**: +1 Talent
- **Simple Ranged**: +1 Talent
- **Complex Melee**: +0 Talent (requires training)
- **Complex Ranged**: +0 Talent (requires training)

## How Damage Works

Unlike traditional RPGs, Anyventure doesn't use separate damage rolls:

1. **Roll your attack** (Talent + Skill dice)
2. **Count successful hits** (dice that beat defense)
3. **Apply weapon damage**:
   - First hit = Base damage
   - Each extra hit = Extra damage

<div class="example-box">
### Longsword
- **Base Damage**: 3 Physical
- **Extra Damage**: 2 Physical per extra hit

If you hit with 3 dice: 3 + 2 + 2 = **7 total damage**
