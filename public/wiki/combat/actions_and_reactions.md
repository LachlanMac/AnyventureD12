## Actions

Many actions are obtained through modules and are more powerful than the standard actions all characters have access to.

### Sprint - 2 Energy
The character moves up to double their movement speed in a straight line.

### Attack - 0 Energy
The character makes an attack with a brawling, throwing, ranged or melee weapon.

<div class="note-box">
When using a special action with an energy cost, that cost is increased by 1 if using a complex weapon.
</div>

### Jump - 1 Energy
The character specifies how many units they want to jump, up to their movement speed. They then roll a fitness check to determine if they were able to make the full jump or if they fall short. If they took either the sprint action or used 2 units of their movement speed immediately before the jump, their fitness check must be greater than or equal to the units they are attempting to jump - otherwise, they only jump a number of units equal to their fitness check. Without a running start, their fitness check is halved and rounded down to calculate the number of units they traverse.

### Grab - 1 Energy
The character attempt to grab another creature and hold onto them until the start of their next turn. This is done by making a contested fitness check 

### Channel - X Energy
The character attempts to channel a spell. The energy cost varies by the spell.

### Defend - 0 Energy
The character preemptively defends themselves, gaining a bonus dice to all defense and contested checks. After using any other reaction, this benefit is lost.

### Shove - 1 Energy
The character attempts to shove another character that is the same size, knocking them prone or pushing them 1 unit away. This is done by making a contested might check against the target's fitness or coordination.

### Use - 0 Energy
The character uses an item, such as drinking a potion, picking up an object or attempting to unlock a door.

### Rest - 0 Energy
The character rests, removing the winded condition. If the character does not have the winded condition, this action instead restores 2 energy.

### Hide - 0 Energy
The character gains the obscured condition described in [Conditions](/wiki/conditions). A character cannot use this action if an enemy can currently see or sense them.

## Reactions

### Attack of Opportunity - 0 Energy
The character makes an attack with a simple weapon or brawling attack against a creature that willfully moves out of their melee range.

The character attempts to cover their eyes to either protect against a vision based attack or protect their eyes. This gives them the blinded condition until the start of their next turn.

### Cover Ears - 0 Energy
The character attempts to cover their eyes to either protect against a sound based attack. This gives them the deafened condition until the start of their next turn.

### Fall Prone - 0 Energy
The character falls to the ground, willfully giving them the prone condition.

## Free Tasks

Some tasks are so trivial that they do not count as an action. A character can only perform 1 free task per round. Some examples include:

<br>

- Pressing a button
- Opening a door
- Peaking around a corner
- Switching to a different weapon
- Attempting to gain information by making a skill check
