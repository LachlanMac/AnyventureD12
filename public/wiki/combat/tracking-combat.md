# Combat

## Tracking Combat
The rules involve keeping track of rounds to determine in what order the characters involve act. For simplicity, combat refers to a stage of gameplay where the tracking of time becomes rigid and players and the GM take turns controlling their characters.

### Rounds
A combat in AnyventureDX is broken down into rounds. A round lasts approximately 6 seconds, making a 10 round fight last a minute.

Rounds are further broken down into **phases**:

- Preperation
- Early
- Middle
- Late

The preperation phase only happens on the first round of any given combat and allows especially quick characters a chance to act before the fight even starts. This can allow the character to reposition themselves, consume an item, or make a skill check to gain more information that may help them during the combat. A character cannot use the preperation phase to make an attack or channel a spell. Not everyone gets to participate in the preperation phase: [Enemies](/wiki/enemies) such as minions and thralls do not roll initiative, and instead always go in the late phase. 


### Initiative
At the start of combat, all involved parties roll an **initiative check** to determine what phase they are allowed to act in during the round. An initiative check is most often done by rolling a coordination check and using that value. The purpose of initiatve is decide the order the characters act in.

After rolling an initiative check, compare the result to this table to decide where the characters act.

| Roll | Phase | Preperation Phase|
|------|--------|--------|
| < 4 | Late | No |
| 4-7 | Middle | No | 
| 8-10 | Early | No|
| > 10 | Early | Yes|

After rolling initiative, it is likely that multiple characters will be in the same phases. There are simple rules that help determine who goes first within a phase:

-Player characters **always** go first
-Enemies go immediately after
-Neutral or allied non-player characters go last

To break ties within those groups, it is most simple for the players to simply decide in what order they want to act. If it suits the table, it is perfectly fine to all act at the same time with staggered turns, but this may not suit the group of players and could potentially bog down play. As a fallback, players can act in order of their initiative.


## Turns

Most characters, including player characters, have one standard turn in a round.
A turn includes
- 2 Actions
- Movement

### Actions
Actions are the main driver of resolving combat. 


### Movement
All characters have the option to use travel a number of units up to their movement speed during their turn. This doesn't have to all be done in one movement.

<div class="example-box">
A character has a movement speed of 5. They move 2 units and use an action to attack an enemy. They then decide to retreat to safety to pull back from the front line and move back the rest of their movement speed, 3 units. The character then uses their second action to drink a potion.

### Reactions

Reactions are very similar to actions, except that they have triggers that can happen at any point, especially when it is not the character's turn. There is no limit to the amount of reactions a character can take, but they are limited by energy. Combat in AnyventureDX is often strategic and involves managing [Resources](/wiki/resources). 

<div class="example-box">
A character uses a powerful action to make a specialized attack with their weapon, costing 3 energy. They have other actions available, but they only have 2 energy left. They are currently surrounded but have several reactions that are defensive in nature, so they elect to save energy for them. They use their second action to make a melee attack with a simple weapon, which does not cost energy. Now, when the enemies make attacks against them, they will be able to react and potentially mitigate the damage.

<div class="note-box">
    Non-player characters have different rules on what they can do on a single turn. 
    Minions and Thralls only get 1 action and movement on a turn and a single reaction each round.
    Elite, Legendary and Mythic creatures on the other hand, get 1 action during each phase of combat for a total of 3 actions.
