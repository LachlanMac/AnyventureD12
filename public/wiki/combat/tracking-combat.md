# Combat

## Tracking Combat
The rules involve keeping track of rounds to determine in what order the characters involve act. For simplicity, combat refers to a stage of gameplay where the tracking of time becomes rigid and players and the GM take turns controlling their characters.

### Rounds
A combat in AnyventureDX is broken down into rounds. A round lasts approximately 6 seconds, making a 10 round fight last a minute.

Rounds are further broken down into **phases**:

- Preperation
- Early
- Middle
- Late

The preperation phase only happens on the first round of any given combat and allows especially quick characters a chance to act before the fight even starts. This can allow the character to reposition themselves, consume an item, or make a skill check to gain more information that may help them during the combat. A character cannot use the preperation phase to make an attack or channel a spell. Not everyone gets to participate in the preperation phase: [Enemies](/wiki/enemies) such as minions and thralls do not roll initiative, and instead always go in the late phase. 

<br>

When all participants have taken their turns, the round is over and the next begins, returning to the **Early Phase**. 

### Initiative

At the start of combat, all involved parties roll an **initiative check** to determine what phase they are allowed to act in during the round. An initiative check is made by making either a concentration or coordination check and using that value. The purpose of initiatve is decide the order the characters act in.

After rolling an initiative check, compare the result to this table to decide where the characters act.

<br>

| Roll | Phase | Preperation Phase|
|------|--------|--------|
| < 4 | Late | No |
| 4-7 | Middle | No | 
| 8-10 | Early | No|
| > 10 | Early | Yes|

<div class="note-box">
   There are certain scenarios where a player can change what phase they act in. The most common is a player deferring to a later stage after their character rolls into one of the earlier phases. This must be decided on the first round of combat immediately after the preperation phase and cannot be reversed.
</div>

<br>

When the initiative order is decided, it is likely that multiple characters will be in the same phases. There are simple rules that help determine who goes first within a phase:

- Player characters **always** go first
- Enemies go immediately after
- Neutral or allied non-player characters go last

<br>

When multiple characters share the same initiative phase, players can choose their turn order among themselves to
coordinate tactics and combos. For faster play, characters in the same phase may declare and resolve actions
simultaneously, though this approach requires clear communication to avoid confusion. If needed, use exact
initiative values as a tiebreaker, with higher rolls acting first within the shared phase.


## Turns

Most characters, including player characters, have one standard turn in a round.
A turn includes:
- 2 Actions
- Movement

<div class="note-box">
    Non-player characters have different rules on what they can do in a single round. 
    Minions and Thralls only get 1 action and movement on their turn.
    Elite, Legendary and Mythic creatures on the other hand, get 1 action during each phase of combat for a total of 3 actions.
</div>

### Actions
Actions represent the primary ways characters interact with the world during combat, from attacking enemies to channeling spells. Each character can perform 2 actions per round, limited by their available Energy, with most actions requiring skill checks to determine success. Default actions like Rest, Sprint, and Attack are available to all characters, while modules unlock specialized actions that define a character's unique combat style.

For detailed information about movement mechanics, see [Movement](/wiki/movement).

### Reactions

Reactions are very similar to actions, except that they have triggers that can happen at any point, especially when it is not the character's turn. There is no limit to the amount of reactions a character can take, but they are limited by energy. Combat in AnyventureDX is often strategic and involves managing [Resources](/wiki/resources). 

<div class="example-box">
A character uses a powerful action to make a specialized attack with their weapon, costing 3 energy. They have other actions available, but they only have 2 energy left. They are currently surrounded but have several reactions that are defensive in nature, so they elect to save energy for them. They use their second action to make a melee attack with a simple weapon, which does not cost energy. Now, when the enemies make attacks against them, they will be able to react and potentially mitigate the damage.

<div class="note-box">
    On the first round of combat, a character cannot use a reaction until they have taken their first turn.
