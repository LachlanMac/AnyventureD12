# Movement

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

Movement is a fundamental aspect of combat and exploration in AnyventureDX. Characters can move around the battlefield to position themselves tactically, escape danger, or reach objectives.

## Movement Speed
On a given turn, a player can move using one of their movement types. The most common movement speed is the *walk speed*. This type of movement does not need to happen all at once and can be spread throughout a turn.

All characters can decide what *type* of movement they are going to use as part of their free movement: *swim*, *climb* or *walk*. Some characters can also *fly* or *burrow.* You cannot mix and match movement types using your free movement.

### Encumbrance

What types of gear a character has equipped determines how mobile they are. A character in full plate armor is going to find it much more difficult to exert themselves or use complex movement such as climbing, swimming or, in the case of wings, flying.

Heavy pieces of equipment have an *Encumbrance Penalty* on them which adds up to a single value. An *Encumbrance Check* is the act of making a fitness check against that total penalty. When a character fails an encumbrance check, they become winded.

### Sprint Action

Characters can use the **Sprint** action to move up to double any of their movement speeds. For example, a character with a climb speed of 3 wants to scurry up a mountain - they can expend an energy to do so. However, sprinting requires making an encumbrance check equal to *double* the encumbrance penalty. 

For more details about the Sprint action and other combat actions, see [Actions & Reactions](/wiki/actions-reactions).

### Walk

The most common type of movement. A character that uses their walk speed does not need to make an encumbrance penalty.

Sprint Action Effect: The character must move in a straight line and roll an encumbrance check against double the encumbrance penalty.

<div class="example-box">
A knight in plate armor and wielding a tower shield has a significant encumbrance penalty of 8 and a walk speed of 5. They are quite far away from the battle, so they first take their free movement and walk 5 units. This does not require making an encumbrance check. They are still far away, so they elect to close the remaining distance by using the sprint action, allowing them to move 10 units. Sprinting using walk speed requires making an encumbrance check against double the encumbrance penalty, so a whopping 16. The knight has a very impressive fitness skill that allows them to roll a 4d12, but it is not possible for them to succeed on this, so they become winded. They must use their second action to recover.

### Swim

Swimming allows characters to move through water, but at a reduced speed. The formula for determining a character's swim speed is *half of their walk speed rounded down*. Unlike walking, swimming requires making an encumbrance check. To sprint while swimming requires making an encumbrance check against double the encumbrance penalty.

If a character does not make one successful swimming check, either by using their movement speed or sprint action, they sink 3 units. If the character ends their turn winded, they also sink 3 units. 

### Climb

Climbing allows a character to traverse objects using hands and feet. The formula for determining a character's climb speed is *half of their walk speed rounded down*. Like swimming, climbing requires making an encumbrance check. To sprint while climbing requires making an encumbrance check against double the encumbrance penalty. 

If a character ends their turn winded while climbing, they cannot hold on anymore, and they fall. This can be mitigated by using specialized climbing gear such as pitons and anchors.

### Movement Penalties

Some terrain may slow movement or require additional effort to traverse, such as making endurance checks through exhausting terrain or might checks when powering through deep snow. These cases are handled by the GM. 

### Conditions

Certain conditions can affect movement:
- **Prone**: Movement is halved while prone
- **Impaired**: Cannot move or take reactions (includes being grappled, tangled, or hobbled)
- **Incapacitated**: Cannot move at all

For complete details on all conditions and their effects, see [Conditions](/wiki/conditions).
