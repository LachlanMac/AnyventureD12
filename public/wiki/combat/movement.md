# Movement

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

Movement is a fundamental aspect of combat and exploration in AnyventureDX. Characters can move around the battlefield to position themselves tactically, escape danger, or reach objectives.

## Movement Speed

All characters have a movement speed that determines how far they can move during their turn without spending additional resources. Most player characters have a base movement speed that can be modified by equipment, conditions, or character abilities.
This movement can be split before, between, or after actions, allowing characters to tactically position themselves.

<div class="example-box">
A character has a movement speed of 5. They move 2 units and use an action to attack an enemy. They then decide to retreat to safety to pull back from the front line and move back the rest of their movement speed, 3 units. The character then uses their second action to drink a potion.

### Sprint Action

Characters can use the **Sprint** action to move beyond their normal movement speed. This action allows a character to move their full movement speed again, but costs energy.

For more details about the Sprint action and other combat actions, see [Actions & Reactions](/wiki/actions-reactions).


### Movement Penalties

Some terrain may slow movement or require additional effort to traverse. This is handled by case by th GM. 

### Conditions

Certain conditions can affect movement:
- **Prone**: Movement is halved while prone
- **Impaired**: Cannot move or take reactions (includes being grappled, tangled, or hobbled)
- **Incapacitated**: Cannot move at all

For complete details on all conditions and their effects, see [Conditions](/wiki/conditions).
