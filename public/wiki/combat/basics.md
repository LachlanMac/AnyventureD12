# Combat Basics

## Combat Overview

Combat in Anyventure is fast, tactical, and deadly. Key principles:
- Rounds are 6 seconds long
- Characters act in initiative order
- Actions and reactions cost Energy
- Damage is determined by attack success, not separate rolls

## Initiative

Combat begins with an initiative check:
- Roll **Coordination** skill
- Act in order from highest to lowest
- Ties go to highest Finesse attribute
- Cannot use reactions until after your first turn

## Your Turn

On your turn, you can:
- Take **2 Actions**
- **Move** up to your Speed (typically 4-6 units)
- Use **Reactions** (after your first turn)

All limited by your available Energy.

## Actions

### Free Actions (0 Energy)
- **Attack**: Make a weapon attack
- **Move**: Use your standard movement

### Standard Actions (1 Energy)
- **Sprint**: Move double your Speed
- **Grapple**: Attempt to restrain an enemy
- **Jump**: Athletics check to leap distance

### Special Actions (2+ Energy)
- **Channel Spell**: Cast a spell (energy varies)
- **Module Actions**: Unique abilities from modules

### Recovery Action
- **Rest**: Remove Winded, gain +2 Energy

## Reactions

After your first turn, you can use reactions:
- **Attack of Opportunity** (1 Energy): Hit enemy leaving your reach
- **Cover Eyes/Ears** (0 Energy): Protect from sensory attacks
- **Fall Prone** (0 Energy): Drop to ground for cover

## Energy System

- Start with **5 Energy** (modified by modules)
- Regenerate **+2 Energy** per round
- Cannot regenerate while **Winded**
- Spend Energy on actions and reactions

## Making Attacks

1. **Declare target and weapon**
2. **Roll attack** (Talent + Skill dice)
3. **Defender rolls defense** (Evasion or Deflection)
4. **Compare results**:
   - Each die that beats defense = 1 hit
   - First hit deals base damage
   - Extra hits deal extra damage
5. **Apply mitigation** if applicable

## Example Combat Round

**Aria's Turn** (Energy: 5/5)
1. Attack goblin with shortsword (free)
2. Move 4 units toward archer (free)
3. Sprint additional 8 units (1 Energy)
4. Attack archer with dagger (free)
5. End turn with 4/5 Energy
