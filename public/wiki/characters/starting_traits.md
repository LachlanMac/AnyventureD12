# Starting Traits

Starting traits represent extraordinary characteristics, supernatural influences, or unique circumstances that set your character apart from others. These traits are typically acquired through rare events, magical influence, or unusual heritage, providing both opportunities and challenges that shape your character's story.

### Trait Mechanics

Starting traits provide powerful abilities that fundamentally alter how your character interacts with the world. Each trait offers multiple options, allowing you to customize exactly how this extraordinary characteristic manifests in your character.

### Choosing Your Trait

Most traits offer multiple manifestations - you must choose one option that best fits your character concept and desired playstyle. Consider how your chosen trait will interact with your ancestry, culture, and planned character development.
