# Cultures

Your culture represents the society and environment that shaped your character during their formative years. Unlike ancestry which is biological, culture is learned and acquired through upbringing, teaching, and social experience. Each culture provides unique restrictions, benefits, and starting equipment that reflect their values and way of life.

### Cultural Restrictions

These represent deeply ingrained cultural values and taboos. Violating these restrictions causes immediate resolve loss, reflecting the internal conflict between your actions and your cultural identity.

### Cultural Benefits

These reflect the advantages of your cultural upbringing - special training, cultural knowledge, or unique perspectives that provide mechanical benefits in appropriate situations.

### Starting Items

These are specialized equipment and tokens that mark your cultural identity and provide practical benefits that reflect your background and training.
