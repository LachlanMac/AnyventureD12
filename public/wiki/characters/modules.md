# Modules System

## What Are Modules?
Modules are the heart of character progression in Anyventure. Instead of traditional classes or levels, characters grow by investing Module Points into themed skill trees that represent archetypes, specializations, and unique abilities.

## Module Structure
Each module follows a **7-tier structure** with **11 total selections**:
- Pattern: 1-2-1-2-1-2-1
- Single-choice tiers: Pick the listed ability
- Dual-choice tiers: Choose one of two options

## Module Points Guidelines
Characters increase in power by acquiring module points rather than levels. Each optional within a module (and purchasing the module, which grants the first option) costs a single option.
All characters start with a number  of module points to help define their archetypes before a game begins. The default number of modules that a character starts with is <b>10</b>. However, for more advanced starts you can refer to the following chart:

| Module Points | Campaign Start | Description |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **4** | Commoner Start | Characters are ordinary people just beginning their journey. Limited combat ability and few specialized skills. |
| **10** | Adventurer Start | Standard starting power level. Characters have basic competency in their chosen fields and some combat experience. |
| **20** | Local Hero Start | Experienced characters with established reputations. Competent in multiple areas with notable specialized abilities. |
| **30** | Champion Start | Veteran heroes with significant power and influence. Masters of their chosen paths with legendary capabilities. |
