# Modules System

## What Are Modules?
Modules are the heart of character progression in Anyventure. Instead of traditional classes or levels, characters grow by investing Module Points into themed skill trees that represent archetypes, specializations, and unique abilities.

## Module Structure
Each module follows a **7-tier structure** with **11 total selections**:
- Pattern: 1-2-1-2-1-2-1
- Single-choice tiers: Pick the listed ability
- Dual-choice tiers: Choose one of two options

### Example Structure:
```
Tier 1: [Single Choice]
Tier 2: [Choice A] OR [Choice B]
Tier 3: [Single Choice]
Tier 4: [Choice A] OR [Choice B]
Tier 5: [Single Choice]
Tier 6: [Choice A] OR [Choice B]
Tier 7: [Single Choice - Capstone]
```
