# Character Creation

Creating a character in Anyventure follows a structured 7-step process that defines your character's abilities, background, and starting power level.

## Step 1: Choose Your Ancestry

Select your character's biological heritage from the available [ancestries](/wiki/races). Your ancestry determines:
- **Size category** and associated bonuses/penalties
- **Innate abilities** and racial traits
- **Lifespan** and biological characteristics
- **Starting language** and cultural ties
- **Physical characteristics** and appearance options

Some ancestries offer choices between different variants or bloodlines - make sure to select your preferred option.

## Step 2: Choose Your Culture

Select the society that shaped your character from the available [cultures](/wiki/cultures). Your culture provides:
- **Cultural restrictions** that may cause resolve loss if violated
- **Cultural benefits** that reflect your upbringing and training
- **Starting equipment** unique to your cultural background

Choose one option from each category: restriction, benefit, and starting item.

## Step 3: Set Starting Points

Determine your character's initial power level:

### Module Points
- **Default**: 10 module points (Adventurer Start)
- **Alternatives**: 4 (Commoner), 20 (Local Hero), 30 (Champion)
- Used to purchase modules and module options
- See [module point guidelines](/wiki/modules#module-points-guidelines) for details

### Talent Points
- **Default**: 8 talent points to distribute
- Used to purchase weapon, magic, and crafting talents
- Cannot exceed 4 points in any single talent category

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

## Step 4: Distribute Attributes

Allocate **6 attribute points** among your five core attributes:
- **Physique**: Physical strength and toughness (affects Fitness, Deflection, Might, Endurance)
- **Finesse**: Agility and dexterity (affects Evasion, Stealth, Coordination, Thievery)
- **Mind**: Mental fortitude and perception (affects Resilience, Concentration, Senses, Logic)
- **Knowledge**: Learning and expertise (affects Wildcraft, Academics, Magic, Medicine)
- **Social**: Interpersonal skills (affects Expression, Presence, Insight, Persuasion)

<div class="note-box">
Character selection is the only opportunity you will have to modify these values. Attributes cannot be acquired through modules or character advancement.
</div>

**Rules**:
- All attributes start at 1
- Maximum of 4 in any attribute
- Must spend all 6 points

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

## Step 5: Select Personality

Choose a personality module that defines your character's nature and social behavior:
- Provides unique social mechanics and roleplay guidance
- **Limitation**: You can only have one personality module
- See available personality modules for options

<div class="triangle-line"></div>

## Step 6: Choose Starting Trait
- See available personality modules for options

Choose a [starting trait](/wiki/starting-traits) that represents extraordinary circumstances:
- Standard options such as more base resources or extra talents
- Special options, such as vampirism and lycanthropy.

<div class="note-box">
Some traits may not fit the setting or theme of a specific game and should be discussed with the GM before considering. Other traits
can have a large impact on not only the individual character, but also the companions they travel with.
</div>

## Step 7: Assign Talents

Distribute your talent points across three categories:

### Weapon Skill Talents
Choose your combat proficiencies:
- **Unarmed**: Natural fighting (starts with +1)
- **Throwing**: Hurled weapons (starts with +1)
- **Simple Melee**: Basic melee weapons (starts with +1)
- **Simple Ranged**: Basic ranged weapons (starts with +1)
- **Complex Melee**: Advanced melee weapons (starts with +0)
- **Complex Ranged**: Advanced ranged weapons (starts with +0)

### Magic Skill Talents
Select your magical affinities:
- **Black Magic**: Necromancy, Witchcraft, Fiend
- **Primal Magic**: Elemental, Nature, Cosmic
- **Metamagic**: Transmutation, Illusion, Fey
- **Divine Magic**: Abjuration, Radiant, Draconic
- **Mysticism**: Spirit, Divination, Astral

### Crafting Skill Talents
Choose your creation abilities:
- **Engineering**: Mechanical devices and constructs
- **Fabrication**: Working with materials and construction
- **Alchemy**: Potions, compounds, and chemical reactions
- **Cooking**: Food preparation and culinary arts
- **Glyphcraft**: Magical symbols and enchantments
- **Bioshaping**: Living matter manipulation


<div class="note-box">
Your talent level determines how many dice you roll for these skills, while your skill level (gained through modules) determines the type of dice you roll. You will have very few opportunities to increase talents beyond your starting choices.

## Step 8: Pick a Language
All ancestries have an associated language that they will learn with mastery. In some situations, you can choose to pick a different language rather than your ancestries, but
you can only learn it at a fluent level rather than with mastery.

## Step 9: Invest Module Points
At this point, you are ready to invest your starting module points to flesh out your character.
