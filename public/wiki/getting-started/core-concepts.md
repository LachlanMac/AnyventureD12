# Core Concepts

## Talents vs Skills

In Anyventure, there's an important distinction between **Talents** and **Skills**:

### Talents
- Represent natural ability (0-4 scale)
- Determine **how many dice** you roll
- Set during character creation
- Rarely change during play
- 0 = Can't attempt, 4 = Gifted

### Skills
- Represent training and experience (0-6 scale) 
- Determine **what type of dice** you roll
- Improve through modules and practice
- 0 = d4, 1 = d6, 2 = d8, 3 = d10, 4 = d12, 5 = d16, 6 = d20

## Example Roll

If you have:
- **2 Talent** in Physique
- **4 Skill** in Fitness

You would roll **2d12** (two twelve-sided dice) and take the highest result.

## The Module System

Modules are the heart of character progression in Anyventure. Each module:
- Has 7 tiers with 11 total abilities
- Follows a 1-2-1-2-1-2-1 pattern (choice tiers have 2 options)
- Grants skills, actions, reactions, and unique abilities
- Can be themed around archetypes (Medic, Necromancer, etc.)

## Resources

Every character has three resources:

### Health
Physical durability and wounds

### Resolve 
Mental fortitude and willpower
- Takes damage from psychic attacks
- Can be spent to stay conscious at 0 Health
- Reaching 0 Resolve causes the "Broken" condition

### Energy
Fuel for actions and reactions in combat
- Default: 5 maximum, regenerate +2 per round
- Most actions cost Energy
- Basic attacks are free
