# AnyventureDX Overview

## Design Philosophy

There are several design philosophies AnyventureDX has to aim to be unique in a vast field of wonderful TTRPGs. AnyventureDX shares a lot with some of the popular tabletop games, but the main unique difference is that this system is designed from the ground up to be played using digital devices for character management. Both the website and the FoundryVTT system implementation have been built up in parallel with the system rules to allow players to easily create characters and get right into the game.

### 1. Classless

AnyventureDX is a classless system that relies on modules for crafting unique characters. In <i>gamer</i> terminology, modules can be best compared to small skill trees that provide a linear path through an archetype in which the prime currency of advancement is module points. A typical character will be made up of several of these, choosing freely when to obtain new modules or invest in ones they currently have.

### 2. Level-less

AnyventureDX has no levels - power is obtained primarily through modules, equipment and character management. Creatures do not have levels either, but they are separated by tiers which helps in determining balance. The growth of a character is designed to be linear and not exponential. Even under the best circumstances, a single player will rarely be able to take on an elite creature by themselves, especially without a large amount of resources.

### 3. No Modifiers

The design philosophy of AnyventureDX is to eliminate modifiers - there is no <i>adding</i> values to dice to determine skill level. Instead, when a character improves in skill, the <b>tier</b> of their dice changes, using a large array of dice [d4 -> d24]. Talent determines how many dice a character rolls, representing consistency. For this reason, players will need to be strategic in what skills they target as being good at everything simply is not possible.


### 4. Simple Magic System

If they have energy, a character can channel a spell they know by rolling a spell check of the school that the spell belongs to. The spell either goes off, or it doesn't. There are no spell slots, but if a character fails to channel a spell, they cannot use it again until they rest.


### 5. Energy Based, Reactive Combat

A character gets 2 actions and movement on each turn, but they are limited what they can do based on energy. A character also has an unlimited number of reactions, making combat more than just "waiting for your next turn". Instead, players must manage their energy to ensure that they have enough for their next turn.


### 6. One Roll Combat Resolution

Instead of rolling to attack and then rolling damage, AnyventureDX uses a one roll resolution system with the defender rolling a defense check and the attacker rolling an attack. The more dice that beat the check, the more damage the attack does. All weapons will have a damage and extra damage stat. So, an attack with a sword that has 5 damage and 3 extra damage where the attacker has three successful dice that beat the defense check would deal 11 total damage. (5 for the damage, 3 for each additional).


### 7. Simple Bonus/Penalty System

When a character has bonuses or penalties due to circumstances or skills, you simply add or remove dice into your pool. Bonuses makes skills more persistent and raises the amount of damage a character can do while penalties negatively affect averages. Accumulating several penalties eventually can cause a character to roll multiple dice but take the lowest!

### 8. Resources

Character management is a crucial part of AnyventureDX. Healing the mind, body and spirit can be an involved process. Characters have the primary resources of <b>health</b> and <b>resolve</b> with <b>morale</b> serving as a buffer to both. Likewise, a character can suffer injuries or have conditions that affect their <b>stress</b> and <b>pain</b> pain levels which can have negative implications.


### 9. Economy & Crafting

The economy is designed to make sense, with values of raw resources determining the value of items crafted from them. Crafting is also designed to be immensely rewarding and customizable. From fabricators that make powerful weapons and armors to biosculpters who can make implants or engineer spores to heal their party, the possibilities are vast. Most items in AnyventureDX have crafting recipes built into the item.


### 10. Designed for Modularity

AnyventureDX was designed to be modular, allowing community contributions and easy homebrewing to create new modules and allow them to be seamlessly integrated into the base data. The system as a whole is meant to serve as a framework where pieces can be removed, changed or added.
