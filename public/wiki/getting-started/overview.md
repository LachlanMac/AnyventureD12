# Anyventure Overview

Welcome to **AnyventureDX**, a classless tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) that emphasizes character customization through modules rather than traditional class restrictions.

## What Makes Anyventure Different?

Unlike traditional TTRPGs, Anyventure has **no classes**. Instead, characters develop through:
###
- **Attributes** that determine your natural talents
- **Modules** - mini skill trees that define your character's abilities
- **Skills** that improve selecting modules and investing points within them
###
There are also no levels in AnyventureDX. Instead of being awarded experience, characters will be awarded module points based on the discretion of the Game Master.
Your character's strength is instead determined by:
###
- **Magic** - the spells that are available to you and your team
- **Equipment** - the quality of your gear, be it crafted or purchased
- **Abilities** - the abilities you have available to you by spending module points
###

## Core Philosophy
Anyventure is built on the principle that characters should be defined by their choices and experiences, not by a class chosen at character creation. Progression is split into two key areas; talents and skills.
###
- **Talents** are innate to your character and rarely able to improve outside character creation. Talents represent consistency.
- **Skills** are what your character actually improves by progressing. Skills represent maximum potential
You can have a talented grasp of knowledge, but you will not be capable of performing medicine if you have no skill in it.
