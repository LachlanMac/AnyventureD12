# Anyventure Overview

Welcome to **Anyventure**, a classless tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) that emphasizes character customization through modules rather than traditional class restrictions.

## What Makes Anyventure Different?

Unlike traditional TTRPGs, Anyventure has **no classes**. Instead, characters develop through:

- **Races** that provide innate bonuses and traits
- **Cultures** that add flavor and social connections
- **Attributes** that determine your natural talents
- **Modules** - mini skill trees that define your character's abilities
- **Skills** that improve through use and training

## Core Philosophy

Anyventure is built on the principle that characters should be defined by their choices and experiences, not by a class chosen at character creation. Any character can learn any skill, use any weapon, or cast any spell - if they invest the time and effort to do so.
