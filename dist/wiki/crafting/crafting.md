# Crafting

Crafting in Anyventure allows characters to create items, weapons, armor, and other useful objects using their skills, materials, and knowledge. The crafting system is built around six core crafting skills, each specializing in different types of creation.

## Core Crafting Skills

- **[Engineering](engineering.md)** - Creating mechanical devices, tools, and structures
- **[Fabrication](fabrication.md)** - Working with metals, forging weapons and armor
- **[Alchemy](alchemy.md)** - Brewing potions, creating chemicals and magical compounds
- **[Cooking](cooking.md)** - Preparing food, beverages, and consumable items
- **[Glyphcraft](glyphcraft.md)** - Inscribing magical symbols, enchantments, and scrolls
- **[Bioshaping](bioshaping.md)** - Manipulating organic materials and living tissue

## Making Items

Creating items through crafting involves three key elements:

### Time
Every crafting project requires time to complete. Simple items might take minutes or hours, while complex creations could require days or weeks of dedicated work. The time needed depends on the item's complexity and the crafter's skill level.

### Difficulty
Each recipe has a difficulty rating that determines how challenging it is to create successfully. This difficulty is modified by:
- The materials being used (some metals are harder to work with than others)
- Environmental conditions
- Available tools and equipment
- The crafter's experience level

### Components
All crafting requires specific materials and components:
- Raw materials (metals, wood, herbs, etc.)
- Refined components (ingots, prepared ingredients, etc.)
- Consumable supplies (fuel, catalysts, binding agents, etc.)

#### Material Consistency
When a recipe requires multiple units of the same material type (such as 2 ingots for a heavy blade), all materials must be of the same type. You cannot mix different metals - an iron heavy blade requires 2 iron ingots, a steel heavy blade requires 2 steel ingots, and so on.

This ensures consistent properties and predictable results. Each material type produces components with distinct characteristics, and mixing would compromise the integrity of both materials.

## Overcrafting

Overcrafting occurs when a crafter achieves exceptional results beyond the minimum requirements - essentially rolling a "critical hit" on their crafting check. Multiple levels of overcrafting are possible on a single project, with each level allowing the crafter to select additional benefits.

The specific overcrafting bonuses available depend on the type of item being created and the crafting skill being used. Common overcrafting benefits might include:
- Improved quality or durability
- Enhanced properties or effects
- Reduced material costs
- Faster completion time
- Additional quantity produced

Each crafting skill offers different overcrafting options appropriate to their specialization, which are detailed on their individual pages.

## Workspace and Equipment

While crafting recipes focus on the specific materials needed, it's assumed that crafters have access to appropriate tools and working conditions for their projects. The exact requirements vary based on context and common sense:

**Fabrication** requires heat sources capable of melting metals, anvils or hard surfaces for shaping, and tools for handling hot materials. A village blacksmith's forge works fine for basic projects, while exotic materials might need specialized magical forges or extreme temperatures.

**Engineering** needs basic woodworking and construction tools, measuring devices, and workspace for assembling components. Most projects can be completed with common tools found in any settlement, though precision work might require better equipment.

**Alchemy** requires containers for mixing, heat sources for distillation, and proper ventilation for safety. A well-equipped kitchen can handle simple recipes, while complex compounds might need dedicated laboratory space.

**Cooking** uses standard kitchen equipment - pots, pans, knives, and heat sources. Most recipes assume access to basic cooking facilities, with specialized dishes potentially requiring specific equipment or techniques.

**Glyphcraft** needs precision writing tools, steady surfaces, and often magical focusing aids. Simple scrolls require only ink and parchment, while powerful enchantments might need rare inks, gemstone dust, or ritualistic environments.

**Bioshaping** requires tools for manipulating organic matter and often sterile or controlled conditions. Basic projects might only need sharp implements and careful handling, while advanced work could require specialized preservation or cultivation setups.

The key principle is that crafters are assumed to have reasonable access to appropriate tools and workspace for their skill level and the complexity of their projects. GMs and players should use common sense - you can't forge steel weapons without intense heat, but you don't need to track every hammer and tong.

## Getting Started

To begin crafting, characters need:
1. **Skill Points** - Invested in at least one crafting skill
2. **Materials** - Appropriate components for the desired item
3. **Recipes** - Knowledge of how to create the desired item
4. **Time** - Sufficient time to complete the project
5. **Access** - Reasonable workspace and tools (see Workspace and Equipment above)

Advanced crafters may also benefit from specialized workshops, rare materials, and master-level techniques that unlock unique recipes and possibilities.
