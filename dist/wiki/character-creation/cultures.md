# Cultures

Your culture represents the society and environment that shaped your character's worldview, values, and psychological makeup. Unlike ancestry which determines biological traits, culture affects your mental resilience, behavioral patterns, and what sustains or stresses your character psychologically.

## Cultural Impact on Mental Health

All cultures in Anyventure have a profound effect on your character's **Resolve** (mental health) and **Stress** levels. Each culture defines:

- **What restores your Resolve** - Actions that align with your cultural values
- **What costs Resolve or causes Stress** - Behaviors that violate your upbringing
- **Special mental abilities** - Unique ways to spend Resolve for benefits
- **Long-term psychological patterns** - How your character maintains mental wellness
