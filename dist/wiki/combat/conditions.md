### Afraid
An afraid character cannot take reactions and must roll a resilience check of 10 whenever they attempt to use an action. On a failure, the afraid character instead moves a number of units equal to their movement speed away from the source of their fear. On a success, the condition ends. Each time this check is made, it is lowered by 1.

### Alert
An alert character automatically makes a senses check when another creature attempts to make a stealth check without costing an action. If they are able to use reactions, they can point out the character that is attempting to stealth revealing them to their allies. A character can choose to become Alert at any time during their turn, but maintaining this heightened awareness requires their concentration.

### Broken
The broken condition happens when a character reaches 0 resolve. While broken, a character rolls with 1 penalty dice on knowledge, social and mind checks and automatically fail checks against the afraid, confused, maddened or charmed conditions. They also cannot recover resolve until the condition is removed. In order to lose the broken condition, a character must make a resilience check of 12 at the end of a full rest. For each full rest taken, this check is lowered by 1.

### Charmed
A charmed character views the person who charmed them as a trusted ally and cannot take aggressive actions towards them. The charmer can issue commands as an action by succeeding on a contested persuasion check against the charmed creature's insight. The charmer also gains a bonus dice to all social checks against the charmed creature.

There are several types of charms with different durations and ways to end the condition. If the charmed person asks the charmed creature to do anything that would cause self-harm or danger to an ally, the next check to break out of the charm is doubled.

### Confused
A character who is confused must roll a 1d4 every time they attempt to take an action or reaction. At the end of each turn, the character can roll a concentration check of 10 to end the condition. This check is lowered by 1 each turn. The confused player states which action they are going to take and then rolls on the following table:

| Roll | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 1 | You make an attack at the closest character if any are in range. If multiple characters are in range the GM will roll randomly to decide the target. |
| 2 | Your action or reaction does not get used and instead you do nothing. |
| 3 | You use your full walk speed to move in a random direction. |
| 4 | You act normally. |

### Dazed
A dazed character loses their concentration and cannot concentrate on anything new until the condition is removed. When you are dazed, the first defense check you make has a penalty dice. This condition is shortlived, and automatically ends at the end of your next turn.

### Maddened
A character who is maddened cannot properly identify friend from standard but is not affected from other mind alterting conditions such as being charmed, confused or afraid. At the end of each turn, they can attempt to recover by making a resilience check of 10. This check is lowered by 1 each turn.

### Numbed
A numbed character cannot gain any resolve and they cannot benefit from morale. Attempts to recover from the maddened, afraid or confused conditions require a check of 4 to break, but does not get lower each time the character attempts to make it. A numbed character has a penalty dice to all mind checks and cannot use resolve to stay conscious when reaching 0 health. In order to lose the broken condition, a character must make a resilience check of 10 at the end of a full rest. For each full rest taken, this check is lowered by 1.

### Bleeding
A bleeding character takes 1 damage at the end of their turn. After the damage is taken, they can roll an endurance check of 10 to stop the bleeding. This check is lowered by 1 each turn.
