# Dice System

## How Dice Work in AnyventureDX
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Anyventure uses a unique dice system where:  

<br>

- **Talent** (from attributes) determines **how many dice** you roll
- **Skill** level determines **what type of dice** you roll
- **Pool** is the term for the total dice you rolled for a skill check

## Skill Checks
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Skill checks are the core of how nearly everything is resolved in AnyventureDX. If you want your character to do anything "non-trivial", you must make a skill check to see if you succeed, fail, or end up somewhere inbetween. These checks are the primary 
way the plot advanced.

<br>
<br>
 
When making a skill check:
1. The GM sets a Required Check (R.C.) for a check to succeed
2. Roll dice based on Talent and Skill (Talent determines how many dice are rolled, skill determines the dice type)
3. Take the highest dice rolled, and that is the value of your check.
4. GM resolves the check based on the success or failure.

### Typical RCs
| Difficulty | Required Check | Example |
|------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
|Trivial     |1         |Tying your own shoe           |
|Simple      |2-3       |Breaking down a wooden door           |
|Easy        |4-5       |Getting a discount from a merchant          |
|Moderate    |6-8       |Balancing on a tight rope           |
|Hard        |9-12      |Interpreting ancient text of a dead language           |
|Extreme     |13-16     |Beating a minotaur in arm wrestling           |
|Legendary   |17+       |Deceiving a dragon           |


## Helping Others
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Skill checks don't have to be done alone. When assisting someone else, a character has two options:

<br> 

- **Help with Same skill**: In order to assist with the same skill, a character must have the same or higher skill. This automatically grants the player you are helping a bonus dice on their skill check.
- **Help wtih a Different skill**: Pick another skill to assist with and roll a single dice if the GM decides the check is relevant. Otherwise, roll two dice for the skill and take the lowest value. If the result of the check meets the R.C., you grant the player you are helping a bonus dice.


## Special Checks
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
There are different types of special checks that have specific rules or are referenced by other rules and modules:

<br> 

- **Attack Checks** - Attacking with a weapon, throwing something or making an unarmed attack.
- **Defense Check** - Making an evasion or deflection check
- **Crafting Check** - Attempting to create a new item based on a recipe
- **Magic Check** - Attempting to channel a spell

<br> 




## Bonus and Penalty Dice
<div class="triangle-line"></div>

Bonus and Penalty dice are a way to represent advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios, either giving you a more likely chance of reaching your potential, or in the case of penalty dice, a greater chance at failure.

### Bonus Dice
Add extra dice to your pool:
- **2 Talent, 3 Skill, +1 Bonus Dice**: Roll 3d10, take highest
- **1 Talent, 4 Skill, +2 Bonus DIce**: Roll 3d12, take highest

### Penalty Dice
When you roll with penalty, you reduce your dice pool. When you cannot reduce your dice pool further, you start rolling more dice, but taking the lowest result.
- **3 Talent, 2 Skill, -1 Penalty**: Roll 2d8, take highest
- **2 Talent, 3 Skill, -2 Penalty**: Roll 2d8, take lowest

<br>

**Note: Penalty and Bonus dice cancel each other out. If you have 2 Bonus Dice and 1 Penalty Dice applied to a roll, this is the same as applying just 1 Bonus Dice.**
