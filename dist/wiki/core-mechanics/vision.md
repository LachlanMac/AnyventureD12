# Vision & Sight

Vision mechanics in Anyventure determine what characters can see, how lighting affects perception, and the various supernatural forms of sight available. Understanding these rules is crucial for exploration, combat, and stealth encounters.

## Standard Vision

### Normal Sight
Most characters rely on regular vision that functions based on available light sources and environmental conditions.

**Requirements**:
- **Light Source**: Adequate illumination from natural or artificial sources
- **Clear Line of Sight**: Unobstructed path between observer and target
- **Range Limitations**: Distance affects clarity and detail recognition

**Visual Clarity by Distance**:
- **Adjacent (0 units)**: Perfect detail, can read small text, identify specific features
- **Nearby (1 unit)**: Clear recognition of faces, objects, and actions
- **Very Short (2-5 units)**: General shape, size, and movement easily visible
- **Short (6-10 units)**: Basic identification possible, details require focus
- **Moderate (11-20 units)**: Movement and general form visible, specifics unclear
- **Distant (21-40 units)**: Large objects and obvious movement detectable
- **Remote (41-100 units)**: Only major landmarks and dramatic changes visible

### Lighting Conditions

#### Bright Light
**Sources**: Sunlight, large fires, magical illumination  
**Effects**: No vision penalties, maximum visual range, full color perception

Characters can see clearly at their maximum visual range and perform detailed tasks without difficulty.

#### Dim Light  
**Sources**: Candles, torches, moonlight, twilight  
**Effects**: Reduced visual range, -1 die penalty to Senses checks for visual detection

Visual range is reduced by half, and fine details become difficult to make out. Colors appear muted, and shadows create areas of uncertainty.

#### Darkness
**Sources**: Night without moon, deep caves, enclosed spaces  
**Effects**: Normal vision cannot function, automatic failure on visual Senses checks

Standard vision is completely ineffective. Characters must rely on other senses, magical assistance, or alternative vision types.

## Enhanced Vision Types

### Darksight
**Range**: Varies (typically 10-20 units)  
**Function**: See clearly in complete darkness as if in dim light

Darksight allows characters to navigate and function in absolute darkness, though the world appears in shades of gray without color.

**Characteristics**:
- **Monochrome Vision**: Everything appears in black, white, and gray tones
- **Heat Signature**: Often detects body heat and warm objects
- **Limited Range**: Functions only within specified distance
- **Light Sensitivity**: Bright lights may cause temporary blindness

**Common Sources**:
- Racial abilities (Elves, Dwarves, some other ancestries)
- Magical spells and enchantments
- Alchemical preparations
- Cursed or blessed conditions

### Truesight
**Range**: Varies (typically 5-15 units)  
**Function**: See through illusions, invisibility, and magical deception

Truesight reveals the true nature of all things within range, piercing through magical concealment and revealing hidden truths.

**Capabilities**:
- **Illusion Detection**: See through all illusion magic and false images
- **Invisibility Negation**: Detect invisible creatures and objects
- **Shapechange Recognition**: See the true form of magically disguised creatures
- **Magical Aura Perception**: Detect magical enchantments and effects
- **Material Truth**: Distinguish real objects from magical constructs

**Limitations**:
- **Limited Range**: Much shorter than normal vision
- **Mental Strain**: May cause headaches or concentration difficulties
- **Overwhelming Information**: Can provide too much sensory input

### Magical Sight
**Range**: Variable  
**Function**: Detect and analyze magical auras and energies

Magical sight allows characters to perceive the supernatural forces that permeate the world.

**Detection Capabilities**:
- **Spell Effects**: See active magical spells and their areas of effect
- **Magical Items**: Identify enchanted objects and their power levels
- **Supernatural Creatures**: Detect beings with innate magical abilities
- **Ley Lines**: Perceive natural magical energy flows
- **Planar Rifts**: Notice tears between dimensions

**Visual Representation**:
- **Color Coding**: Different schools of magic appear in distinct colors
- **Intensity Levels**: Brightness indicates magical power strength
- **Flow Patterns**: See how magical energy moves and concentrates
- **Residual Effects**: Detect lingering magical traces

## Vision in Combat

### Line of Sight
**Definition**: Clear, unobstructed path between two points

**Blocking Elements**:
- **Solid Objects**: Walls, large rocks, thick vegetation
- **Creatures**: Large creatures block sight to targets behind them
- **Magical Effects**: Some spells create visual barriers
- **Environmental**: Smoke, fog, heavy precipitation

**Tactical Implications**:
- **Targeting**: Cannot attack what you cannot see
- **Spell Selection**: Some spells require line of sight to targets
- **Positioning**: Control sight lines for tactical advantage
- **Cover**: Use visual obstructions for protection

### Concealment and Visibility

#### Obscured Condition
**Cause**: Partial visual obstruction (light fog, dim lighting, foliage)  
**Effect**: You are harder to detect and target accurately

**Mechanical Benefits**:
- **Detection Difficulty**: +1 difficulty to Senses checks to spot you
- **Attack Disadvantage**: Attackers have -1 die penalty when targeting you
- **Stealth Bonus**: +1 die bonus to Stealth checks

#### Hidden Condition  
**Cause**: Complete visual concealment (total darkness, heavy cover, invisibility)  
**Effect**: You cannot be directly targeted unless detected

**Mechanical Benefits**:
- **Targeting Immunity**: Cannot be directly targeted by attacks or spells
- **Detection Required**: Enemies must make successful Senses checks to locate you
- **Surprise Potential**: First attack gains significant bonuses

### Stealth and Detection

#### Active Searching
**Action Required**: Yes (Concentrate and scan area)  
**Skill Used**: Senses + Mind talent  
**Modifiers**: Lighting, concealment, movement, distractions

Characters can actively search for hidden enemies, secret doors, or concealed objects.

**Search Modifiers**:
- **Lighting Conditions**: Bright light (+1 die), dim light (no modifier), darkness (-2 dice)
- **Target Movement**: Moving targets easier to spot (+1 die)
- **Concealment Quality**: Poor hiding (-1 die), excellent hiding (+2 die difficulty)
- **Distractions**: Combat or noise (+1 die difficulty)

#### Passive Awareness
**No Action Required**: Automatic while conscious  
**Skill Used**: Senses + Mind talent  
**Baseline**: Notice obvious changes and movement

Characters automatically notice significant changes in their environment without actively searching.

**Automatic Detection**:
- **Movement**: Large or sudden movements in peripheral vision
- **Light Changes**: New light sources or sudden darkness
- **Sound Correlation**: Visual confirmation of heard noises
- **Obvious Threats**: Clearly visible dangers approaching
