# Spellcasting

Magic in Anyventure follows a talent and skill-based system similar to weapons and other abilities. To cast spells, characters must have both the magical knowledge and the specific spell in their repertoire.

## Magic Types & Schools

There are 5 main types of magic, each with 2 standard schools and 1 exotic school:

### Black Magic
- **Necromancy**: Death, undeath, and spirit manipulation
- **Witchcraft**: Curses, hexes, and dark enchantments
- **Fiend** *(Exotic)*: Demonic pacts and infernal powers

### Primal Magic
- **Elemental**: Fire, water, earth, air manipulation
- **Nature**: Plant, animal, and natural world magic
- **Cosmic** *(Exotic)*: Stellar and celestial forces

### Metamagic
- **Transmutation**: Changing matter and energy
- **Illusion**: Deception, concealment, and false images
- **Fey** *(Exotic)*: Chaotic fairy magic

### Divine Magic
- **Abjuration**: Protection, banishment, and holy barriers
- **Radiant**: Healing, purification, and divine light
- **Draconic** *(Exotic)*: Ancient dragon magic

### Mysticism
- **Spirit**: Soul magic, communication with spirits
- **Divination**: Prophecy, scrying, and knowledge magic
- **Astral** *(Exotic)*: Planar travel and astral projection

## Casting Mechanics

### Magic Talents
Characters have talents in each magic type (0-4), representing their natural affinity:
- **0**: Cannot use that type of magic at all
- **1**: Basic understanding
- **2**: Competent practitioner  
- **3**: Skilled mage
- **4**: Naturally gifted

### Magic Skills
Skills in specific schools determine spell complexity (0-6 levels):
- **0**: d4 (basic cantrips)
- **1**: d6 (simple spells)
- **2**: d8 (moderate spells)
- **3**: d10 (advanced spells)
- **4**: d12 (expert spells)
- **5**: d16 (master spells)
- **6**: d20 (legendary spells)

### Spell Checks
To cast a spell, roll: **[Magic Talent]d[Skill Die]**, take the highest result.

**Example**: A character with 3 Primal Magic talent and 2 Elemental skill would roll **3d8** to cast elemental spells.

### Difficulty & Complexity
Each spell has a **Complexity** rating that your spell check must meet or exceed:
- **Complexity 4**: Simple utility spells
- **Complexity 6**: Basic combat spells
- **Complexity 8**: Moderate effects
- **Complexity 10**: Powerful spells
- **Complexity 12+**: Master-level magic

### Energy Cost
Channeling spells costs **Energy** based on the spell's power level. Most combat spells cost 1-3 Energy to cast.

## Spell Effects

### Targeting
Unlike weapon attacks, most spells have predetermined difficulty numbers for enemies to avoid them. For example:
- **Firebolt** might require enemies to make a **DC 6 Evasion** check to dodge
- **Charm Person** might require a **DC 8 Resilience** check to resist

### Damage
Spell damage is typically fixed rather than rolled:
- **Firebolt**: 5 Heat damage
- **Lightning Bolt**: 7 Lightning damage
- **Ice Shard**: 4 Cold damage + Slowed condition

### Range
All spells have optimal ranges. Casting outside this range may impose penalty dice:
- **Adjacent** (0 units): Touch spells
- **Nearby** (1 unit): Close range
- **Short** (6-10 units): Medium range
- **Moderate** (11-20 units): Long range
- **Distant** (21-40 units): Extreme range

## Making Casting Easier

### Rituals
Casting a spell as a **ritual** takes 1 hour but reduces the Complexity by 2. Rituals cannot be performed in combat but are useful for:
- Utility magic outside of combat
- Practicing difficult spells
- Ensuring success with important magic

### Components
Using the proper **component** for a spell reduces Complexity by 2 but consumes the component. Components vary by spell:
- **Material components**: Special ingredients, gems, metals
- **Focus items**: Wands, staves, crystal orbs
- **Rare components**: Dragon scales, celestial water, etc.

### Combining Both
Rituals and components **stack** - using both reduces Complexity by 4 total, making even master-level spells achievable for dedicated practitioners.

## Spell Slots

Characters have limited **spell slots** representing how many different spells they can maintain in their active memory. Spell slots are gained through:
- Character creation choices
- Magic-focused modules
- Special training or items

### Managing Spells
- You can only cast spells you currently "know" (have in spell slots)
- Swapping spells requires downtime and practice
- Some modules allow more flexible spell management
- Forgetting a spell frees up the slot immediately

## Magical Failure

### Failed Casting
If your spell check fails to meet the Complexity:
- **Spell fails** - Energy is still spent
- **No negative effects** unless specified
- **Can try again** next turn (if you have Energy)

### Critical Failures
On a natural 1 (if using optional rules):
- Spell backfires or has unintended consequences
- Possible magical mishaps or wild magic effects
- GM discretion on specific results
