# Spellcasting

Magic in Anyventure follows a talent and skill-based system similar to weapons and other abilities. To cast spells, or **channel**, characters must have both the magical knowledge and the specific spell in their repertoire. The difference is that how successful on you are while casting a spell does not change the outcome of that spell. Instead, casting spells is simply a pass/fail. 


## Casting Mechanics
<div class="triangle-line"></div>

If a player knows the spell, they attempt to channel it by rolling a **spell check**. This is the same as a normal skill check, but using one of the 5 magical skills; Black Magic, Meta Magic, Primal Magic, Divine Magic or Mysticism Magic.
As with other skill checks, the player rolls a number of dice equal to their talents, and the dice type is equal to their skill.

<br>

The player takes their highest dice from that pool, and that becomes the value of the spell check. **All spells have a required check to channel**. If the spell check is greater than the required check, the spell is cast.

<div class="example-box">
A character with 3 talent and 2 skill in Primal Magic would roll **3d8** to cast elemental spells.
</div>

### Energy Cost
Channeling spells costs **Energy**. In order to attempt to cast a spell, a player must first spend the energy to do it.

### Components
All spells have **components** which are used in the challening process and are used to focus magic to make the process more safe. Components are consumed when the spell is channeled, on success or failure.


<div class="example-box">
The spell Mend has "silver shards" listed as a component. These shards will be consumed when the spell is channeled regardless of success of failure.
</div>


There are some items called **focuses** that allow you to replace needing a component for a spell. For example, the silver idol is a focus that replaces the need for silver shards as a component. However, these items can break when you fail to channel a spell while using them. The rules for this are typically built into the item, usually having a chance to break based on failing to cast a spell. 

### Manaburn
A character can channel a spell without a component by using a **Manaburn**. Manaburning is both dangerous and inefficient; a way to use your own lifeforce to attempt to cast a spell. When you channel a spell without a component, you take true damage equal to the required check of the spell. If you fail, this damage is doubled. Reaching 0 health due to performing a manaburn makes you unable to use magic until you complete your next full rest. 

### Charging Spells
Charging is a way to get an extra effect or potency from a spell. Every single spell in AnyventureDX has a **charge effect** listed in the spell description. 

There are a few rules to remember when channeling a spell:

- You must declare that you are charging a spell before channeling it
- It is not possible to attempt to charge a spell without using the component
- Charing a spell increases the required check by +2
- Charing a spell with a focus consumes the focus as if it were the component

## Rituals
<div class="triangle-line"></div>
Rituals allow a character to channel a spell over a long duration. Casting a spell as a ritual has some differences:

- Rituals cannot be channeled without components
- A successful ritual results in the spell being automatically charged without requiring a difficulty increased
- Other characters can assist in the ritual, improving the chance of success

### Assiting Rituals

One of the major benefits of rituals is having other characters be able to help and contribute towards the success of a spell. When taking part in a ritual, there are two options:

<br>

**Roll a spell check**: The character rolls a spell check from the school of magic that the spell is from. If the helper rolls half of the spell's original required check rounded up, they add +1 to the final check. Otherwise, they apply a -1 penalty.

<br>

**Roll a magic check**: The character rolls a magic knowledge check. If the helper rolls equal to or higher than the original required check, they add +1 to the final check. Otherwise, they apply a -1 penalty.

Assissting in rituals makes channeling spells possible that would normally not be so for a single character.

<br>

<div class="example-box">
 A Lich Lord wants to raise an army of dead to bring destruction to the world. This spell requires a check of 22; an impossible feat alone because, while his skill check for channeling a necromancy spell like this is 4d20, his maximum score he can achieve is a 20. To aid in his success, the Lich gathers his 10 strongest generals who don't excel as much at him as necromancy, but still can contribute with their serviceable Dark Magic 3d16 checks. For each check 11 or higher they roll, they add a +1 to the Lich Lord's final check. Each general has about a 2/3 chance of succeeding, and a 1/3 chance of hurting the ritual. The Lich Lord rolls a 19, so he needs at least 3 more success than failures which is going to be a close call!
</div>

## Managing Spells
<div class="triangle-line"></div>

When a character wants to channel a spell, they must <i>know</i> the spell. By default, a character can only know 10 different spells. This number is known as a character's **spell capacity** and can be increased through modules. If a character wants to acquire a new spell, but they do not have the spell capacity, they can simply forget the spell as if they never knew it.

### Learning New Spells

Learning spells is relatively easy and not that different from channeling a spell normally. In order to learn a new spell, the character must complete the spell's ritual but with an required check that is +2 higher than the spell usually requires. This naturally restricts spells based on the channeler's skill. Naturally, this only applies to the normal **subschools*. Unless a player has a module or trait that specifically allows them to learn spells from an **exotic school*, they cannot learn from it.

<div class="example-box">
If a character has a +3 skill in Dark Magic with 2 talents, their maximum possible roll is an 8. This ensures, that without help from an outside source, the character could never learn a spell with a required check higher than 8.
</div>

<br>

There are some caveats to learning spells in this way:

- For spells that require a target, you must have a valid target. This means potentially enlisting a friend to be your test dummy.
- For spells that require a specific focus, like a resurrection spell requiring a corpse that meets certain conditions, you must have that available.
- Despite normal ritual rules, the spell is not charged when you successfully channel it for the first time in order to learn it.
- As with normal rituals, you can also have friends help using the rules in **assisting rituals**.

<div class="note-box">
  For creating a character, it would be a shame to make an archetype that relies heavily on spells but start with none known. For this reason, it is recommended that a GM allow a player to select 5 spells that have a required check 2 less than their maximum magic skill for that school. So, if a character had +1 in one of the magic skills, the maximum they could roll is a 6. This would mean they could learn spells from a normal subschool under that school that has a required check of 4 or lower to start the game with.
