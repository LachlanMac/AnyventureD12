# Learning Spells

Learning new spells in Anyventure requires dedication, practice, and often expensive components. Unlike simply knowing how to cast magic, learning specific spells involves research, experimentation, and mastery of the magical formulae.

## The Learning Process

### Requirements for Learning
To learn a new spell, you must:

1. **Meet the minimum magic requirements** (talent + skill)
2. **Have an available spell slot** to store the new spell
3. **Perform the learning ritual** with required components
4. **Successfully complete the complexity check**

### Learning Ritual Requirements

#### Time Investment
Learning a spell **always** requires performing it as a **ritual** (1 hour of focused practice).

#### Component Requirement  
You **must** use the spell's required **component** during the learning process. This component is consumed whether you succeed or fail.

#### No Reduction Benefits
Unlike normal spellcasting, when learning a spell you **do not** get the complexity reduction benefits from ritual casting or components. You must succeed at the spell's **full complexity** despite using both requirements.

**Example**: Learning *Firebolt* (Complexity 4)
- Must perform 1-hour ritual ✓
- Must use component (sulfur powder) ✓  
- Must roll against **Complexity 4** (no reduction to 0)
- If you have 2 Primal talent + 1 Elemental skill = 2d6, need to roll 4+

## Learning Difficulty Examples

### Simple Spells (Complexity 4-6)
- **Requirements**: Basic magical training
- **Components**: Common materials (herbs, simple minerals)
- **Time**: 1 hour practice
- **Success Rate**: High for competent mages

### Moderate Spells (Complexity 8-10)  
- **Requirements**: Skilled magical training
- **Components**: Uncommon materials (quality gems, rare herbs)
- **Time**: 1 hour intense practice
- **Success Rate**: Challenging even for skilled practitioners

### Master Spells (Complexity 12+)
- **Requirements**: Expert magical knowledge
- **Components**: Rare/expensive materials (diamonds, dragon scales)
- **Time**: 1 hour of extremely focused ritual work
- **Success Rate**: Difficult even for masters

## Research and Practice

### Multiple Attempts
- **Failed attempts** consume components but teach you nothing
- **You can try again** with new components
- **Each attempt** requires a full ritual (1 hour + component)
- **No limit** on attempts (except cost and time)

### Studying Complex Magic
For particularly difficult spells, consider:

#### Gradual Approach
- Learn prerequisite or related spells first
- Build up your magical skills before attempting
- Study with mentors or magical texts

#### Resource Management
- **Expensive components**: Plan and save for multiple attempts
- **Rare components**: May require quests or special procurement
- **Time constraints**: Learning takes significant downtime

### Example Learning Scenarios

#### Resurrection Magic
- **Spell**: *Raise Dead* (Complexity 14)
- **Component**: Diamond worth 500+ gold
- **Practice**: Must have access to suitable corpses
- **Reality**: May take multiple expensive attempts and significant preparation

#### Combat Magic
- **Spell**: *Lightning Bolt* (Complexity 6)  
- **Component**: Copper wire bundle
- **Practice**: Safer to practice in controlled environment
- **Strategy**: Moderate investment, reasonable success rate

## Spell Slot Management

### Limited Capacity
- **Spell slots** represent your mental capacity for maintaining spell knowledge
- **Forgetting spells** frees up slots immediately
- **Learning new spells** requires available slots

### Strategic Decisions
Consider these factors when managing your spell repertoire:

#### Utility vs Combat
- **Combat spells**: Needed for immediate threats
- **Utility spells**: Useful for exploration and problem-solving
- **Situational spells**: Powerful but narrow application

#### Flexibility vs Specialization
- **Broad repertoire**: More options, less mastery
- **Focused selection**: Fewer options, better at what you do
- **Adaptive approach**: Change spells based on expected challenges

## Learning From Others

### Mentorship
- **Experienced mages** can provide guidance and reduce learning difficulty
- **Magical institutions** may offer formal training programs
- **Apprenticeships** combine learning with practical experience

### Spell Scrolls and Tomes
- **Spell scrolls**: May provide insights into spell structure
- **Magical tomes**: Contain detailed formulae and theory
- **Ancient texts**: Might contain lost or rare magic

### Collaborative Learning
- **Study groups**: Share costs and knowledge
- **Research partnerships**: Pool resources for expensive components
- **Magical academies**: Structured learning environments

## Special Considerations

### Exotic Schools
**Fey, Fiend, Cosmic, Draconic, Astral** magic may have additional requirements:
- **Special locations**: Fey crossings, demonic altars, astral nodes
- **Pact requirements**: Agreements with otherworldly entities  
- **Rare knowledge**: Ancient texts or oral traditions
- **Dangerous practice**: Risk of attracting unwanted attention

### Forbidden Magic
Some spells may be:
- **Legally restricted**: Banned by local authorities
- **Morally questionable**: Necromancy, mind control
- **Inherently dangerous**: Risk to caster or others
- **Cosmically significant**: Attract planar attention

### Cultural Restrictions
Different cultures may:
- **Prohibit certain schools**: Religious or cultural taboos
- **Require licensing**: Official permission to practice
- **Demand oaths**: Ethical commitments for powerful magic
- **Impose penalties**: Consequences for unsanctioned practice
