When creating a module, here are the instructions:
If it is a secondary module, we need to make sure we don't have overlap between any other module (especically core modules)
We need to make sure there are at least 2-3 actions/reactions mixed in.
We should only give the big skill bonuses (weapon/magic skills) at either tier 5 if the module is very specific, or as a choice in tier 6.
For instance, a shaman module may get a choice at tier 6 to go primal spell path or mysticism spell path because either could work.
When we give +1 to a skill that isn't one of the wepaons/magic/crafts, we should generally try to give a passive effect with it that is creative

Actions for weapons can have type themes as well between Slashing, Bludgeoning or Piercing.  If an action does require one of those, it should be noted. "This action requires a weapon with the Slashing property"

Besides that, we can do things like:

Add max health, resolve, energy (rarely)
Add mitigations if it makes sense
Add immunities to conditions
Add senses
Add languages
Things that grant temproary health or resolve
and more...Refer to the rules document to really expand creativity.

Dont' EVER give the same skill twice. For example. Do not give +1 endurance in 2a, then +1 endurance in 6b.
